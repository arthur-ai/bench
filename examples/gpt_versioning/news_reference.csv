Moscow’s Ministry of Defense said on Sunday that two top Russian commanders have been killed in eastern Ukraine.

Russian state news agency TASS reported Sunday that commanders Colonel Vyacheslav Makarov and Colonel Yevgeny Brovko were killed during fighting in Donetsk, a region in eastern Ukraine. Ministry Spokesman Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov said in a statement Sunday that Makarov was “seriously wounded” and died when evacuating the battle, according to TASS.

“Commander of the 4th motorized rifle brigade, Colonel Vyacheslav Makarov, personally led the battle while on the front line. Two enemy attacks were repelled, and the soldiers of the brigade destroyed three tanks, four infantry fighting vehicles, and two armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” Konashenkov said.

“During the battle to repel one of the attacks, Colonel Yevgeny Brovko heroically died after receiving multiple shrapnel wounds,” Konashenkov added.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that Ukraine will not attack Russian territory in a planned counteroffensive this spring, instead saying that it aims to free occupied territory in his country. Speaking alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Zelensky responded to speculation that Ukraine may target Russian territory.

“We don’t attack Russian territory, we liberate our own legitimate territory,” Zelensky told reporters. “We have neither the time nor the strength (to attack Russia).”","Two top Russian commanders, Colonel Vyacheslav Makarov and Colonel Yevgeny Brovko, were killed during fighting in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, according to Moscow’s Ministry of Defense.

1,"Title: Rudy Giuliani sued by former employee for alleged sexual assault and harassment

A former associate is suing Rudy Giuliani for alleged sexual assault and harassment, wage theft and other misconduct, accusing the former mayor and Trump lawyer of making ""sexual demands"" and going on ""alcohol-drenched rants that included sexist, racist, and antisemitic remarks,"" many of which were allegedly recorded.

Noelle Dunphy said she began working for Giuliani in 2019 as his director of business development. Giuliani ""began abusing Ms. Dunphy almost immediately after she started working for"" him, according to her lawsuit.

""He made clear that satisfying his sexual demands -- which came virtually anytime, anywhere -- was an absolute requirement of her employment and of his legal representation,"" the lawsuit said.

According to Dunphy, Giuliani promised her a $1 million annual salary but the offer came with a catch: Giuliani was in the midst of an acrimonious divorce and he told Dunphy that her pay would have to be deferred and her employment kept ""secret"" until the divorce proceedings finished. He claimed that his ""crazy"" ex-wife and her lawyers were watching his cashflow and that his ex-wife would ""attack"" and ""retaliate"" against any female employee that Giuliani hired, the lawsuit said.

Part of the job required Dunphy to record her interactions with Giuliani ""anytime, anywhere, as well as Giuliani's interactions with others,"" the lawsuit said.

""But unbeknownst to Ms. Dunphy, Giuliani apparently decided during the interview that he would use the job offer and his representation as a pretext to develop a quid pro quo sexual relationship with Ms. Dunphy. He was later recorded telling Ms. Dunphy, 'I've wanted you from the day I interviewed you,'"" the lawsuit said.

Ted Goodman, political and communications adviser to Giuliani, told ABC News in a statement: ""Mayor Rudy Giuliani unequivocally denies the allegations raised by Ms. Dunphy ... Mayor Giuliani's lifetime of public service speaks for itself and he will pursue all available remedies and counterclaims.""

According to the lawsuit, a week into her employment, Giuliani had Dunphy flown to New York on a chartered plane and insisted she stay in a guest suite in his Upper East Side apartment. The two drank and at one point ""Giuliani then pulled her head onto his penis, without asking for or obtaining any form of consent. He held her by her hair. It became clear to Ms. Dunphy that there was no way out of giving him oral sex. She did so, against her will,"" the lawsuit said.

Giuliani often demanded that Dunphy work naked, in a bikini, or in short shorts with an American flag on them that he bought for her, the lawsuit said.

""When they were apart, they would often work remotely via videoconference, and during those conferences Giuliani almost always asked her to remove her clothes on camera. He often called from his bed, where he was visibly touching himself under a white sheet,"" the lawsuit said.","Former associate Noelle Dunphy is suing Rudy Giuliani for alleged sexual assault and harassment, wage theft, and other misconduct.

2,"Title: Victor Wembanyama's best fits among 2023 NBA draft lottery teams

There are 30 NBA teams, and 30 NBA teams would love to draft France’s Victor Wembanyama in the June draft.

And given his all-purpose skillset for his size at 7-3, Wembanyama is a fit for any team.

But there are only 14 teams in the draft lottery, which takes place Tuesday on ESPN, and only one of them will get the winning combination of ping pong balls.

Let’s take a look of some of the lottery teams and where the best landing spot is for Wembanyama, the 19-year-old considered one of the best prospects to enter the draft.

NBA draft lottery 2023: How to watch, how it works, who will be No. 1?

Follow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules

7. San Antonio Spurs (14% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)

Wouldn’t it be something if the Spurs landed Wembanyama and accelerated their rebuild with another potential generational star, like they did with Tim Duncan in 1997. The Spurs have a track record, under Coach Gregg Popovich, of drafting, developing and maximizing international players, including Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.

6. Indiana Pacers (6.8% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)

Pacers coach Rick Carlisle has one of the great minds in the league. Erudite with appreciation for the Grateful Dead, Carlisle has coached Dirk Nowitzki and Luka Doncic. Imagine what he might able to do with Wembanyama in his offense.

5. New Orleans Pelicans (.5% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)

Laissez les bon temps rouler! Let the good times roll in New Orleans and make Wembanyama feel at home. Get him a meal at Antoine’s. Pair him next to a healthy Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram. Make the Pelicans a force. Alas, the Pelicans have the worst odds. But they can dream, can’t they?

4. Detroit Pistons (14% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)

The Pistons didn’t make the strides they wanted, and Cade Cunningham’s injury impeded progress. There are some pieces to work with, specifically Cunningham, Jaden Ivey, Jalen Duren and Isaiah Stewart. With Wembanyama, the Pistons can envision a drastic improvement.

3. Houston Rockets (14% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)

The Rockets need help, and, like the Pistons, they have young talent that could someday form the nucleus of a good team with Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr., Alperen Sengun, Jabari Smith Jr., Kenyon Martin Jr. and Tari Eason. Ime Udoka is Houston’s new coach, and while he has work to do with the team, Wembanyama makes it easier.

2. Orlando Magic (9% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)

The Magic are intriguing with their young, improving team: Rookie of the Year Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner, Jalen Suggs, Cole Anthony, Wendell Carter Jr. and Markelle Fultz. The Magic were 34-48 this season under second-year coach Jamahl Mosley, a 12-win improvement over 2021-22. Wembanyama makes the Magic something more than just the No. 8 seed.

1. Portland Trail Blazers (10.5% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)

Damian Lillard, 32, has been loyal to the Trail Blazers and wants to win there. It would be wonderful for Lillard to get the kind of help that makes Portland a competitor in the West. As much as any draft pick of the past three decades, Wembanyama, it appears, can help make that happen soon.

Despite being a fit for any team, the article highlights the top 6 lottery teams that could benefit from his skills, including the San Antonio Spurs, Indiana Pacers, New Orleans Pelicans, Detroit Pistons, Houston Rockets, and Orlando Magic.

3,"Title: I’m 39, with a biological age of 23 — here’s how I do it

He’s aging in reverse – literally.

Chris Mirabile, the founder and CEO of a consumer longevity biotech company called NOVOS, claimed that he’s a 39-year-old with a biological age of around 23, and he’s now sharing his tips with the world.

While biological age tests can be controversial, one expert says they are an astute indication of the amount of “damage” that has gone on inside of your body.

The test aims to measure the rate at which your body is aging.

Mirabile, who survived a brain tumor when he was younger, has some aging hacks won’t cost much money, and are simple to implement in your own routine.

While appearing on the John Barrows’ “Make It Happen” podcast in August 2022, Mirabile offered up one of his most powerful tips to the audience – and it’s simpler than you may expect.

“150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity is enough to extend your health span and lifespan by a significant margin,” he claimed while on the podcast.

Chris Mirabile is 39 – but he says he has a biological age of around 23. Slow My Age

He explained that if you go for a brisk walk for 20 minutes per day every day, it will almost bring you to the 150 minute mark. Mirabile also recommended doing body weight exercises twice a week, especially focusing in on your legs.

Exercising on a regular basis can support brain health, strengthen your muscles and bones, and even help reduce your risk for disease, according to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Mirabile used doing squats as a good example of body weight exercises, suggesting you build up your endurance starting from 20 reps. He said you can even do this while watching television.

According to The Daily Mail, Mirabile himself works out six times per week, splitting it up with three cardio sessions and three weight lifting sessions.

“By intense I don’t mean anything crazy,” he told The Daily Mail. “So, like a six to eight-mile run, basically anything I can fit into my schedule — 45 minutes to an hour — and I have to make a point not to push myself too hard.”

He emphasized the importance of intermittent fasting, a healthy diet, and exercise. Slow My Age

Another tip Mirabile revealed was the importance of intermittent fasting, and making sure that you have a 12-hour time restricted window where you’re eating – at the least.

“One of the most important things to consider is your eating window, the time in which you’re eating,” Mirabile said while on the podcast.

He referenced a researcher at the Salk Institute in California, Dr. Satchidananda Panda, explaining that it’s better to eat within a shorter window of time.

“The smaller the eating window that you can make, the better it is for your overall health,” Mirabile claimed while on the podcast.

“Studies have found, for example, that two people can eat the same exact foods, but if you eat in a smaller period of time, it can have a significantly better health outcome in terms of cardiovascular risk, so on and so forth.”

Mirabile said that he eats healthy 90% of the time, especially during the work days, according to The Daily Mail.

Some of the typical foods in his diet include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and berries – but he doesn’t hesitate to enjoy a treat every now and then, indulging in two “cheat meals” around once a week, the outlet reported.

He admitted, however, that he does’t shy away from having a cheat meal here or there. Getty Images/iStockphoto

“So, I might have a pizza on a Friday night and then a dessert on a Saturday, but I try not to have the pizza and the dessert at the same time because that is a lot all at once,” he told DailyMail.com.

Getting a good night’s sleep is also crucial, he revealed, recommending that you clock in eight hours of rest per night, according to The Daily Mail.

Getting good sleep is important for anyone’s physical and emotional well-being, and it’s recommended by The Cleveland Clinic for adults to get anywhere from seven to eight hours per night.

Sleeping also helps with the function of your nervous system, according to The Clinic.

The Post reached out to Mirabile for comment.

However, Mirabile isn’t the only person who has claimed to have a younger biological age.

Dr. Mark Hyman is 63, but says he has a biological age of 43.

In his list of tips, he recommended says smoothies, meditation and cold plunges, among others.","Chris Mirabile, founder and CEO of NOVOS, a consumer longevity biotech company, claims to have a biological age of 23 at 39 years old.

4,"Title: Nikki Haley on Trump’s Sexual Battery Verdict: ‘I Was Not on the Jury’ – Rolling Stone

When asked if a New York jury finding Donald Trump liable for sexual battery and defamation undermines the Republican Party, GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Sunday made sure to note that Trump has appealed the verdict, and that altogether, “the American people need to make a decision based on that.”

Trump must pay $5 million to writer E. Jean Carroll, who is reportedly considering filing another lawsuit against the former president after he called her a “whack job” with a “fake story” during last week’s CNN town hall.

Haley, one of the GOP’s most high-profile women, reacted to the outcome of the civil lawsuit on CBS “Face the Nation.”

“I have always said that anyone that feels like they have been sexually assaulted in any way should come forward and have their voice heard,” Haley told anchor Margaret Brennan. “I also think anyone that’s been accused should be able to defend themselves. I was not on the jury. I am not the judge. I think that both of them had their voices heard. There has been a verdict and there’s even an appeal.”

.@margbrennan: ""Do you think it undermines your party if the Republican front-runner is someone who was just found legally liable for sexually abusing a woman?""@NikkiHaley: ""I was not on the jury. I am not the judge…There has been a verdict and there's been an appeal."" pic.twitter.com/jzs8pFYOBI — Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) May 14, 2023

Brennan followed up by asking Haley if she doubted the outcome of the case.

“No,” Haley said. “I said there’s a verdict. And I think there’s been an appeal. And I think it stands where it stands. And I think the American people need to make a decision based on that.”

Haley made similar comments about the case to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in an interview last Wednesday, saying that Trump “has got to answer for it.”

“But you know,” she added, “it’s not my case. It’s his case.”

In his deposition for the lawsuit, the former president was asked about the 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which he says that when you’re “a star” you can grab women “by the pussy.” Trending Taylor Swift Defends Fan From Security Guard at Philadelphia Show MTV News Confidential: Kurt Loder, Tabitha Soren, and John Norris Tell All ‘Succession’ Makes Us Relive Trump’s Presidential Election Trump Rips Enemies, Ignores Melania in Mother’s Day Post

“It’s true that they can grab women by the pussy?” a lawyer asks Trump in the videotaped deposition.

“If you look over the last million years, I guess that’s been largely true — not always, but largely,” he replies. “Unfortunately or fortunately.”","Nikki Haley, a GOP presidential candidate, commented on the recent verdict that found Donald Trump liable for sexual battery and defamation. Haley noted that Trump has appealed the verdict and that the American people need to make a decision based on that. She also stated that anyone who feels sexually assaulted should come forward, and anyone accused should be able to defend themselves. Haley did not doubt the outcome of the case and said that Trump has to answer for it. However, she also noted that it is not her case, but his."
5,"Title: Microsoft wins EU antitrust approval for Activision deal vetoed by UK















BRUSSELS, May 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) won EU antitrust approval for its $69 billion acquisition of Activision (ATVI.O) on Monday, in a significant boost that could prompt Chinese and South Korean regulators to follow suit despite a British veto of the deal.

The U.S. software giant still faces a battle to clinch the world's biggest gaming industry takeover, however. It has until May 24 to appeal a decision by Britain's Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) to block it. A final decision may take months.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission's case against the deal is also pending at the agency, though Japan approved it in March.

The European Commission said the transaction was pro-competitive due to Microsoft's agreement to licence popular Activision games such as ""Call of Duty"" to rival game streaming platforms, confirming a Reuters report in March.

Such licences are ""practical and effective"", European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager told reporters.

""Actually they significantly improve the condition for cloud game streaming compared to the present situation, which is why we actually consider them pro-competitive,"" she added, contrasting with the UK position that the deal would hit competition in that part of the market.

In rejecting the deal, the UK watchdog was seen as flexing its muscle on the global regulatory stage since Brexit.

Microsoft has in recent months signed licensing deals with Nvidia (NVDA.O), Nintendo (7974.T), Ukraine's Boosteroid and Japan's Ubitus to bring Activision games to their platforms should the deal go through.

""The European Commission has required Microsoft to license popular Activision Blizzard games automatically to competing cloud gaming services. This will apply globally and will empower millions of consumers worldwide to play these games on any device they choose,"" said Microsoft President Brad Smith.

Activision's shares were up 1.3% at 1650 GMT, while Microsoft's were little changed.

CLOUD GAMING MARKET GROWTH

Vestager said the Commission had a different view from UK regulators of how the game streaming market, which accounted for just 1% of the total market last year, would develop.

""They see this market developing faster than we would think,"" she said. ""There is a bit of a paradox here, because we think that the remedies that we have taken ... will allow for licensing to many, many more in the cloud gaming markets.""

Britain's CMA said streaming was the most rapidly growing sector in gaming, while consoles were a mature market. It said Microsoft already accounted for 60-70% of global cloud gaming services and had other trump cards: Xbox, the leading PC operating system Windows and cloud provider Azure.

The CMA said on Monday it stood by its veto. Microsoft has said it will appeal that decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, with a ruling expected to take months.

The EU move will give CMA critics ammunition against the agency, said Alex Haffner, a partner at London law firm Fladgate.

""Critics of the CMA's stance, of which there have been many, will inevitably seize on today’s decision as proving the point made that the UK's regulatory regime is too rigid and stifles innovation,"" he said.

""Microsoft and Activision’s lawyers will also use the decision to provide greater ballast to their appeal of the CMA's decision.""

If you’re using a Pixel 6 or Pixel 7 series device, you might want to hold off updating to the May 2023 security patch if you haven’t already, as the update seems to be wreaking havoc with battery life and heat.

Update 5/15: Google has identified the cause of this issue and has rolled out a fix. Read more

Google Pixel 6, 6 Pro, 6a, Pixel 7, and 7 Pro owners are reporting issues with their phones overheating and draining battery exceptionally quickly following the May 2023 update. In some cases, this is leading to battery life being cut in half, if not worse, and the phone being hot to the touch.

User reports of these problems first started coming out around May 6, just days after the update was released, and have continued in the time since.

Another potentially related issue seems to be coming from the Google app, which appears to be running in the background and using system resources to the point of both overheating the phone as well as draining battery life. Some affected users have spoken out on Reddit, saying that the issue is appearing both on current stable and beta versions of the Google app. Some have also found that the “Android System Intelligence” app is showing high battery usage in system settings.

Both issues seem to be fairly widespread, with hundreds of comments across multiple Reddit threads and Google’s support forums regarding the issue. Personally, my Pixel 7 Pro doesn’t seem to have been hit, though I did see some epically bad battery life late last week just after updating to the May patch, it just hasn’t been repeated since. Our Damien Wilde says that his Pixel 7a had fine battery life before installing the May 2023 patch, but has noticed a downturn since.

Google has yet to issue any public response to the problem, and customer support doesn’t seem to be helpful according to some users who have gone that route. Rolling back to prior versions of the Google app doesn’t seem to help, either.

If your Pixel is affected, drop a comment below and let us know.

Thanks, Darren!

7,"Title: Florida teacher says she is under investigation after showing 5th grade class Disney movie with gay character

CNN —

A fifth-grade teacher said she is being investigated by the Florida Department of Education after she showed her students “Strange World,” a 2022 animated Disney movie featuring a character who is biracial and gay.

Jenna Barbee, a teacher in Hernando County’s Winding Waters K-8 school, told her story in a widely viewed TikTok post over the weekend.

“I am the teacher that’s under investigation with the Florida Department of Education for indoctrination for showing a Disney movie,” she said.

In the video, Barbee explained she played the Disney movie to a class, which was only partially full after a day of standardized testing. She also said she had previously-signed permission slips from all the parents, allowing the students to watch a movie rated PG.

According to Barbee, a parent then complained and reported her to the state Department of Education.

The parent who reported her, who is also a member of the Hernando County School District Board, complained to the principal about the movie not being appropriate for students, according to Karen Jordan, spokesperson for Hernando County Schools. Jordan also provided CNN with a copy of the announcement from the school district to parents.

“Yesterday, the Disney movie ‘Strange World’ was shown in your child’s classroom,” the school district said. “While not the main plot of the movie, parts of the story involves a male character having and expressing feelings for another male character. In the future, this movie will not be shown. The school administration and the district’s Professional Standards Dept is currently reviewing the matter to see if further corrective action is required.”

The complaint is part of Florida’s controversial legislation, signed last year by Gov. Ron DeSantis, banning certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. DeSantis and other supporters pushed the measure as a form of “parental rights,” while opponents said it tried to erase LGBTQ people from schools and dubbed the law “Don’t Say Gay.”

The law initially banned instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten through third grade or in a way deemed not age-appropriate for all other grades, but it has since been expanded to limit such information all through high school. Teachers who violate the state policy can be suspended or have their teaching licenses revoked.

Disney was among those who spoke out against the law last year, spurring DeSantis and Florida Republicans to retaliate against the entertainment company by targeting their control over the land in and around its theme parks.

The animated film “Strange World,” released last year, told the story of a family of explorers and starred the voices of Jake Gyllenhaal, Dennis Quaid and Lucy Liu. The movie also featured Disney’s first-ever out-gay character, voiced by comedian Jaboukie Young-White.

Teacher says movie was tied to lesson plan on environment

Jenna Barbee addressed the issue at a Hernando County school board meeting last week. From Hernando School District

On May 9, Barbee addressed the school board members during public comment at a meeting. In attendance was the parent who had complained, school board member Shannon Rodriguez, she acknowledged during the meeting.

“A school board member, an elected official of power, who was supposed to be nonpartisan, is allowed to present to the public that she is Christian and that God appointed her to the board. And yet it is indoctrinated that I showed a Disney movie. I’m a first-year teacher,” said Barbee.

The teacher told district board members the movie was in no way sexual and was tied to the current lesson plan of the environment and ecosystems.

Barbee claimed in the meeting Rodriguez “came to my school took me away from my students to tell me how bad and wrong I was.”

At the end of the school board meeting, Rodriguez said she called the state department of education regarding the incident, which prompted the state investigation. She said her daughter is in Barbee’s class.

She said at the district meeting Barbee broke school policy because she did not get the specific movie approved by school administration and said the teacher is “playing the victim.”

“It is not a teacher’s job to impose their beliefs upon a child: religious, sexual orientation, gender identity, any of the above. But allowing movies such as this assist teachers in opening a door, and please hear me, they assist teachers in opening a door for conversations that have no place in our classrooms,” Rodriguez said.

Rodriguez said, “as a leader in this community, I’m not going to stand by and allow this minority to infiltrate our schools … God did put me here,” she said.

Florida Department of Education press secretary Cassie Palelis said the complaint will be reviewed by an investigator, and an attorney will then provide a recommendation to the commissioner for next steps.

“I understand that the individual in question has discussed her case publicly. However, we will not allow politics and media pressure to dictate our process,” Palelis said.

CNN has reached out to Rodriguez and the Hernando County School District for comment.","A fifth-grade teacher in Florida is under investigation by the Department of Education for showing her students the Disney movie ""Strange World,"" which features a biracial and gay character.

8,"Title: NBA playoffs 2023 predictions: Anonymous scout, coach, exec pick Nuggets-Lakers, Celtics-Heat winners

Which remaining Eastern Conference team will advance to the NBA Finals, Jayson Tatum’s Boston Celtics or Jimmy Butler’s Miami Heat? Which remaining Western Conference team will advance, Nikola Jokić’s Denver Nuggets or LeBron James’ Los Angeles Lakers?

We spoke to some experts to find out.

We asked a scout, a coach and a team executive to predict the outcomes of the Eastern Conference finals between the Celtics and the Heat and the Western Conference finals between the Nuggets and the Lakers. We granted our experts anonymity because their employers did not give them permission to discuss other franchises publicly. Anonymity also allowed them to be completely candid.

Eastern Conference

No. 2 Boston Celtics vs. No. 8 Miami Heat

Scout’s outlook: “I’m picking Boston. They’re just better. They have home court. They’re deeper. Both teams are coming off very good series wins, I think Boston in particular, the way they won Game 6 and Game 7. Their defense has just been spectacular. I think Miami’s going to have real trouble scoring.

“The Heat are so Jimmy Butler-reliant. And they’ve got one go-to guy. I don’t think Bam (Adebayo’s) a go-to guy. I don’t think the other guys are go-to guys. And Boston’s got guys who can cover him, not stop him. But you can put (Marcus) Smart on him. Maybe you put (Jayson) Tatum on him. You can put (Malcolm) Brogdon on him, maybe. Grant Williams.

“Miami has had a weird year. They were poor shooting the 3 during the year and they shot it very well in the prior series. Are they going to regress to the mean? Their matchups also are going to be a problem.

“Boston, are they going to go big again with (Robert) Williams? Or are they going to start (Derrick) White? If they start White, who’s Kevin Love going to guard? So it’s going to be interesting to see if Boston goes small. You have some matchup issues with Love.

“Boston’s got a better bench. They’ve got two stars versus one superstar. I think if Miami won two games it’d be an accomplishment.”

Coach’s outlook: “There’s going to be competitiveness and physicality. There’s going to be all kinds of coverages and schemes and tactics. I believe this is going to be a tough seven-game series, and I think Boston is going to come out on top. I just think they’re more experienced (together). I think they just have a little bit more in terms of scoring. But it’s just hard to count Miami out.

“The Heat are gritty. They’re grimy. You have to beat Miami. (They don’t beat themselves.) They run their sets. They execute, make or miss. They don’t blow sets. They don’t turn the ball over a ton, and for the most part, they’ve been controlling tempo and the pace of the game. I think that’s what helped them in the Milwaukee series. I think that’s what helped them in the New York series as well.

“I know everybody talks about physicality, right? If you watch Miami defend, they have multiple guys that can defend with physicality: Bam Adebayo, Kyle Lowry, Gabe Vincent and, of course, Jimmy Butler. You’ve got a slew of guys who are not afraid to put their body on you. It’s going to come down to a few things: probably some shot making. It might come down to adjustments, to different lineups, going small or going big, putting a shooting lineup in. I have no idea what both coaches have in store. But if this Eastern Conference finals are going to be like anything we saw in the first round or in the second round, we’re going to be watching an unbelievable series. But I’ve got Boston coming out of the Eastern Conference finals.

“Jayson Tatum? ‘Humbly,’ he said, ‘I’m one of the best basketball players in the world.’ Well, (I think) you might be the best, kid. Your time is definitely coming. To put on a performance like that in a Game 7, that’s just unbelievable. The stakes are higher. There’s more pressure. The consequences are greater. And you drop 51 points in a Game 7? Unbelievable. And the kid is only 25 years old. Oh, my God.”

Executive’s outlook: “To me, with the (Heat’s) dream playoff run, you wake up at some point from your dream. I don’t know how Miami’s doing it, to be honest with you. But they just keep doing it. And I just think at a certain point it’s gonna come to a stop, the magical playoff run. And I think Boston is good enough to end it.

“I would have said Philly or Boston over Miami, just for the reasons that I said. So of course it was a nice pick-me-up for Boston to play a game like that (in Game 7) and get their confidence back and really start feeling good about themselves going into this series. But I think both teams are better — Philly or Boston. In this case, Boston’s just better. I’ll say six games. I don’t think it’ll go seven.”

Western Conference

No. 1 Denver Nuggets vs. No. 7 Los Angeles Lakers

Scout’s outlook: “Home court matters there probably more than most places. Denver’s got the best player. I mean, you could argue LeBron now. But Jokić is the best player in this series. Denver’s got a better starting team. Maybe I’ll give a slight edge to the Lakers’ bench, especially with their playoff performances.

“(Rui) Hachimura was great. (Dennis) Schröder came on in the last series. Hachimura was a big factor. Can he maintain that level? Shooting 50 percent from 3, his numbers are a little beyond what people have expected.

“The thing with Denver is they haven’t been there. KCP (Kentavious Caldwell-Pope) has been there, but otherwise nobody else has got a ring, I don’t think, on their team.

“But Anthony Davis has to be consistent throughout. I’m not sure he can be. He has played all the games, but he’s been pretty up and down. And he’s going to have to be great for them to win.

“The Lakers have played how many good games together? I’m not sure whether that will matter, but Denver’s been together the whole year. I saw them in February and even then they were one of the most cohesive teams I’ve seen. That has a lot to do with Jokić and also that they’ve played together for a little while now. You can’t say the same about the Lakers. So I think the continuity factor could play a role.

“My only question about Denver is whether the moment’s too big.”

Coach’s outlook: “The way the Lakers are playing right now, they’re really playing unbelievable basketball. Everybody sees after the trade deadline the pieces that they brought in to where you can do multiple things. You can put ’Bron on the ball; you can put ’Bron off the ball. You can put D’Angelo Russell on the ball; you can put DLo off the ball. And you can play through Anthony Davis. They have a ton of offense now. They defend a lot better. They have quickness on the perimeter with (Dennis) Schröder. Even Austin Reaves, he’s a tough defender; he’s better than what a lot of people give him credit for. (Jarred) Vanderbilt does a good job with his length. I think Vanderbilt’s defense on Jamal Murray is going to be critical. That’s not going to be (Vanderbilt’s) only matchup. I believe they’re going to throw some different guys on (Murray), some different schemes and coverages at him. But I really believe the Lakers are going to win a game on the road, just like they did in the first two series. …

“With the Lakers, how do you defend Nikola Jokić? The last time these two teams played in the Western Conference final in the bubble, I thought the Lakers had a luxury with the depth of their bigs. The Lakers had JaVale McGee, Dwight Howard and Anthony Davis, and McGee and Howard just beat up Jokić. From a physicality standpoint, they went in there and they took fouls. They didn’t care. They beat him up every single time. The Lakers don’t have that physicality anymore. So what schemes and coverages are you going to do differently for Nikola Jokić, because I just don’t believe that Anthony Davis is the end-all, be-all with him. So I’m very eager to see what they’re going to come up with for Jokić; I mean, he’s a tough coverage. You can’t really trap him on the block — he’s going to make you pay with every kind of pass known to man. So do you play him straight-up? Do you double him on the perimeter? …

“It’s going to be a very tough series. Denver has multiple defenders that they can throw at LeBron, starting with Aaron Gordon. I’m almost sure he’s going to start on LeBron, but you can throw Bruce Brown and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope at him. They have a number of guys that they can throw at LeBron, so when one guy gets worn out and he’s tired from the way ’Bron is trying to score or play with force, you can throw another guy on him and you just keep rotating bodies and keep them fresh to where they really make ’Bron work to score.”

Executive’s outlook: “I say Denver (will win), for three reasons. Home-court advantage. They’ve been great at home. Two, I just think that in that Anthony Davis-(Nikola) Jokić matchup that Davis will wear him down. Jokić will wear down AD. And then three, I just wonder: I know LeBron (James) is invincible, but at a certain point does he wear down a little bit? Especially the longer this series is extended? I mean, I know he’s Superman, but at a certain point he’s got to wear down.

“Denver has the superior talent in the backcourt with (Jamal Murray). I like both guards from the Lakers — both (D’Angelo Russell and Austin Reaves) are good, and (Dennis) Schröder, too. I mean, they’ve got nice depth back there now. But I just think Murray is a superior player, a superior talent.”

“(When you ask me to compare this matchup to these teams’ Western Conference finals matchup in 2020, I’d say) the 2020 matchup was a bubble matchup. Being in the bubble, I don’t know how much any of that was real, to a certain extent. I mean, the games were played, the players were playing and the competition was occurring. But I don’t know. I think it’s just so much different now with the travel and the full season now. You think about that shortened season. I don’t know if it’s even comparable. Let’s go seven games, only because you give LeBron his due.”

9,"Title: Boston Celtics vs. Philadelphia 76ers: TV channel, Game 7 prediction, odds, time, live stream, watch online

After two consecutive wins, the Philadelphia 76ers had a golden opportunity to close out their Eastern Conference semifinals series with the rival Boston Celtics in front of their raucous home crowd in Game 6 on Thursday night and end their conference finals drought, but they were ultimately unable to do so.

After a sluggish start to the game that saw them fall behind 15-3 out of the gate, the Sixers shook off some early nerves, climbed back into the contest over the course of the first half and found themselves down by just seven at halftime. They were able to erase that deficit entirely in the third quarter and took a two-point lead into the final frame. At that point, they were in control of their own destiny -- up 3-2 in the series with a lead heading into the fourth quarter in their own building. Closeout opportunities don't come too much more ideal than that.

Things didn't go Philadelphia's way in that fourth quarter, though, as their offense bogged down, and they were able to muster just 13 points over the final 12 minutes of action. The Celtics, on the other hand, scored 24 points during that same span, and they were able to pull out a season-saving 95-86 victory as a result. Now, the series is tied at three games apiece and the decisive Game 7 will be played in Boston, where the Celtics will have the home crowd -- and any lingering momentum -- behind them. Here's a look at the start time, viewing information, odds, storylines and a prediction for the contest.

Celtics vs. 76ers, Game 7

Storylines

76ers: This closeout game will be all about star power for Philadelphia. The Sixers need their two stars -- Joel Embiid and James Harden -- to show up in a big way if they're going to secure their first conference finals berth since 2001. Embiid has been solid in the series, but he went nearly the final four minutes of Game 6 without taking a shot while the contest slipped away from Philly. That simply can't happen. The big man needs to be assertive and dominant from the opening tip. If he can consistently put pressure on Boston's defense, get them in foul trouble and generate open opportunities for his teammates, the Sixers should have a real chance to walk away with a win.

Similarly, the Sixers need an aggressive version of James Harden. Harden has had two 40-point performances in the series, but he scored in the teens in the other four games. He needs to come out with an aggressive mindset and aim to collapse Boston's defense. I wrote last week that Harden's level of aggression could ultimately decide the series, and that remains the case.

Celtics: The goal for the Celtics has to be to get Jayson Tatum going earlier in the game. Tatum has struggled mightily in the first halves of recent games, and he had a total of just three points through the first three quarters of Game 6 before he exploded for 16 points in the final frame to save the Celtics' season. Tatum averaged over 30 points per game during the regular season, but he has hit the 30-point threshold just twice in the six games in the series so far. A lot of that has been due to first half struggles. A stronger start would likely lead to a more consistently productive performance, so look for Boston to be proactive when it comes to generating ample scoring opportunities for Tatum early on in Game 7.

Prediction

This has been a back-and-forth series, and it's tough to predict how it will end as neither team has been especially consistent. However, I picked the 76ers in seven games prior to the start of the series, so I'm sticking with it. In order for that to happen, both Embiid and Harden will need to be at the peak of their powers, as mentioned above. The Sixers have already won twice in Boston in this series, so they're clearly capable of it. The game projects to be pretty close either way, so even if the Celtics win, I'll take the Sixers with the points. Pick: 76ers +6.5","The Philadelphia 76ers failed to close out their Eastern Conference semifinals series against the Boston Celtics in Game 6, losing 95-86. The series is now tied at three games apiece, with the decisive Game 7 to be played in Boston. The Celtics will have the home crowd advantage and momentum behind them. The game will be all about star power for the 76ers, who need Joel Embiid and James Harden to show up in a big way. The Celtics are favored to win by 6.5 points, with an over/under of 201."
10,"Title: Exploding airbag inflators strike again—1 million GM SUVs are recalled

There's another massive airbag safety scandal brewing. Last week, General Motors issued a recall for almost a million SUVs in order to replace potentially dangerous airbag inflators, the third such recall it has had to issue for this problem.

Many vehicles from other OEMs (including BMW, Hyundai Motor Group, and Stellantis) may also contain the same inflators, which can rupture during inflation, spraying shrapnel during a crash. But the supplier that manufactured the airbag inflators has rejected claims by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that there is a systematic defect.

The airbag inflators in question were manufactured by ARC Automotive, a tier-two automotive supplier based in Knoxville, Tennessee, and NHTSA has had an inkling of the problem for some years now. In fact, NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation started a preliminary evaluation in 2015 of ARC's airbag inflators and whether they could rupture dangerously, following two reports of people suffering shrapnel injuries during a crash when their driver's airbag deployed.

The following year, NHTSA upgraded that preliminary evaluation into a full engineering analysis following news of a fatal incident in Canada involving an ARC airbag inflator in a 2009 Hyundai Elantra.

NHTSA says that 67 million airbag inflators of this design have been produced for the US market by 2018, including 11 million made by Delphi under license. Following 2018, ARC altered its manufacturing process to better detect debris; NHTSA says it has not seen any issues in airbag inflators made post-2018.

GM has actually conducted two recalls in the past to address this issue. In February 2022, it recalled 413 model-year 2013–2017 Chevrolet Traverse SUVs and 143 model-year 2008–2017 Buick Enclave SUVs as it believed they contained potentially suspect airbag inflators. Then, in April 2022, it recalled another 2,687 vehicles (542 model-year 2015 Buick Enclaves, 1,183 model-year 2015 Chevrolet Traverses, and 916 model-year 2015 GMC Acadias) for the same reason.

But in April of this year, GM learned that the front airbag in a model-year 2017 Chevrolet Traverse had its airbag ruptured during deployment by an ARC inflator. GM says that out of an abundance of caution, it is recalling all front airbag modules containing the problematic inflator. These were fitted to model-year 2014–2017 Chevrolet Traverse, Buick Enclave, and GMC Acadia SUVs—in total, 994,763 cars are affected.

GM also says it has been working with an independent engineering firm with expertise in airbags to determine the root cause of the failures, but it hasn't arrived at an answer yet.

Owners of affected vehicles will be contacted by GM and will have their front driver airbag module replaced.","General Motors has issued a recall for almost a million SUVs due to potentially dangerous airbag inflators manufactured by ARC Automotive.

Hailey Bieber is sharing more about her thoughts on growing her family with husband Justin Bieber.

In a recent interview with The Sunday Times, the model and entrepreneur reportedly said she would like to have kids but worries about the public scrutiny the couple faces.

“It’s enough that people say things about my husband or my friends,” she said. “I can’t imagine having to confront people saying things about a child.”

She and Justin Bieber got engaged in July 2018. They quietly married months later in New York City before celebrating with a big ceremony at luxury resort Montage Palmetto Bluff in Bluffton, South Carolina, in October 2019.

Despite her concerns, Hailey Bieber said she isn’t going to let fear keep her from welcoming children.

“We can only do the best we can to raise them,” she said. “As long as they feel loved and safe.”

Her husband is on the record as looking forward to fatherhood, telling Ellen DeGeneres in 2020 that he’s following his wife’s lead.

“I’d love to have myself a little tribe,” Bieber said. “But, yeah, it’s her body and whatever she wants to do.”","Hailey Bieber expressed her desire to have children with husband Justin Bieber but worries about the public scrutiny they face.

BERLIN — A court in the eastern German city of Dresden found five family members of a criminal gang guilty of a $129 million (113 million euro) jewelry heist Tuesday and sentenced them to more than four years in prison. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight It was one of Europe’s most notorious and daring jewel heists when members of Berlin’s Remmo clan broke into the Grünes Gewölbe (Green Vault) museum at Dresden’s Royal Palace in the early hours of Nov. 25, 2019, in a smash-and-grab operation that made off with some of Europe’s most valuable jewels.

The stolen pieces included a breast star of the Polish Order of the White Eagle, a jewel-encrusted sword and an ornate headpiece. The entire hoard was covered with in 4,300 diamonds in total. Authorities fear some of the items will never be recovered.

The five men, all in their 20s, were sentenced Tuesday to between four and six years in prison. A Dresden regional court found them guilty of “particularly serious arson” in combination with dangerous bodily harm, theft with weapons, property damage and “intentional arson” to cover up a criminal offense. A sixth defendant and family member was acquitted after providing an alibi.

In January, the defense, prosecution and the court reached a plea bargain after most of the 21 stolen pieces of jewelry were returned in December 2022. However, some of the most important pieces featuring large diamonds — including the 50-carat Saxon White Diamond — remain missing, Dresden prosecution confirmed.

Witness statements in the trial transcripts detailed the damage to some of the recovered items. During a witness hearing, one restorer from the Dresden State Art Collections, Eve Begov, described pieces that were broken and deformed as well as damaged by moisture. Others were scratched or marred by rust.

Two of the five defendants are already serving sentences for the theft of an enormous gold coin from Berlin’s Bode Museum in 2017 — another daring heist that rocked the museum world. The coin was never recovered.

Closed-circuit TV footage released a day after the audacious heist showed how the museum and the neighboring area were plunged into darkness after the thieves set fire to a circuit breaker near the museum.

They then entered the building through a window. Prosecutors said the men had damaged the bars on the window ahead of the heist and reattached them to enable quicker access.

Within five minutes, they broke a display with an ax, took 21 objects covered in thousands of jewels and left in a getaway car. The vehicle was later set alight in an underground parking lot.

Dozens of people are still wanted in relation to the meticulously planned heist. Authorities say they believe about 40 people were involved.

Barbara Klepsch, regional culture minister of Saxony — the state of which Dresden is the capital — said Tuesday she was grateful that investigators had been able to secure a large part of the stolen jewelry.

“A part of the wound in our treasury has been closed again and the perpetrators were lawfully convicted,” she said.

The minister also said that security measures had been adjusted as a result of the heist, which shed light on shortcomings in security at one of Europe’s oldest museums.

The eastern state of Saxony has claimed damages amounting to almost 89 million euros for the stolen items, as well as for damage caused by the break-in.

The stolen jewels are part of a collection amassed by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony, in the 18th century. In 1723, Augustus opened Dresden’s Green Vault to display his treasure trove. Located in Dresden’s Royal Palace, the museum remained closed for decades after suffering extensive damage during World War II. It was restored and reopened in 2006.

14,"Title: Trump weaponizes FBI-Russia report he demanded to keep fighting the election that never ends

CNN —

A long-awaited report by Republican-appointed special counsel John Durham failed to find the “crime of the century” that ex-President Donald Trump said targeted him at the center of the Russia investigation. But it delivered him a potential political payoff nonetheless.

The 300-page conclusion to a three-year probe also dealt another blow to the Federal Bureau of Investigation over its handling of the reputation-shredding 2016 election. Durham said that the bureau’s full-scale probe into multiple links between the Trump campaign and Russians should never have been launched, arguing that investigators “discounted or willfully ignored” information that did not support preliminary theories that there was collusion between Trump and Russia. And he called on the Justice Department to appoint an official to oversee politically sensitive probes. But while Durham criticized confirmation bias and mistakes in the FBI, he did not unveil any new prosecutions – undermining Trump’s predictions of a sweeping purge of the bureau – and had no recommendations for further reforms in the FBI.

Still in a passage of the report that is certain to be highlighted by the former GOP president for political purposes, he argued that neither US law enforcement officials nor the intelligence community appears to have had “any actual evidence of collusion” before investigating Trump. And the special counsel also criticized the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier, a now largely debunked document that was used by the FBI to secure surveillance warrants against a former Trump campaign adviser.

But not much of what Durham revealed on Monday was new and while it was not the complete fail that some partisan media commentators on the left claimed, it certainly lacked the kind of blockbuster indictments once predicted by the former president and his family.

Those debates aside, the polarization of American politics, everything involving Trump and the bitter aftermath of the 2016 election means that perceptions of links between his team and Russia will depend for many citizens on their ideological perspective and opinion of Trump.

That means the Durham report’s main legacy is now certain to be political. It offered an immediate opening for the former commander in chief who has never worried about nuance. Trump was quick to claim vindication for his claims that a massive deep state plot was designed to thwart him from power seven years ago, even though the report made no such firm conclusion. And Trump trampled the scope of Durham’s conclusions to infer that by extension, multiple current criminal probes against him – including two by another special counsel into his attempts to overthrow the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents, are politically motivated. “The American Public was scammed, just as it is being scammed right now by those who don’t want to see GREATNESS for AMERICA!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Another Trump ally, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, argued the report showed the “rule of law in America is subservient to political outcomes. It is a very dangerous development and moment in American history,” he said in a statement. Some might consider Graham’s comments ironic since the same charge was often leveled at Trump while he was in office, and the ex-president challenged the rule of law in his bid to remain in office in 2020.

But House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio, a top Trump ally, signaled he’ll use Durham’s report to invigorate his probe into what he claims is the “weaponization” of government against Trump and Republicans. Jordan’s accusations represent a popular belief among pro-Trump conservatives, but they have so far failed to make a convincing jump into mainstream political debates.

Still, Trump’s original purpose in demanding an investigation into the FBI was to create a political shield over past and future investigations, he won a significant victory on Monday. The former president has promised a gutting of US intelligence and law enforcement agencies that have held him to account if he is elected to a second term in 2024. And his strength in the GOP means that Republicans who might challenge him for the nomination must fall into line.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for instance lashed out at “weaponized federal agencies” manufacturing a Russia collusion narrative. “It reminds us of the need to clean house at these agencies, as they’ve never been held accountable for this egregious abuse of power,” DeSantis wrote on Twitter.

FBI under pressure again over Trump investigations

Skeptics of the investigation have long pointed out that it was started by former Attorney General William Barr when he was under fierce pressure from the then-president to investigate those investigating his 2016 campaign. Some analysts said the fact Durham only managed to win one conviction related to the Russia investigation and reproduced criticisms of the FBI’s conduct from a previous inspector general’s report proved that the probe was an expensive waste of money set up to prove a false political theory.

Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who is now a senior CNN national security analyst, blasted the report Monday as a “political errand” to exact retribution against Trump’s enemies in the FBI.

Despite McCabe’s critique however, the findings of the Durham report are likely to make the FBI even more loath to launch investigations involving political campaigns during presidential elections. The bureau has already implemented multiple reforms to address conclusions of the prior inspector general’s report that found problems with applications for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court Warrants.

The election that never ends

The Durham report also deepens the imbroglio caused by the 2016 election when the FBI was also accused of influencing the campaign to the detriment of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by publicly reopening a probe into her handling of classified emails days before Election Day. Now it stands accused by a special counsel of improperly investigating the Republican nominee as well. While Democrats might mistrust Durham’s motivations. They are urging on a current special counsel Jack Smith in the hope that he will indict Trump. Cherry-picking between special counsels is only likely to further hamper distrust in the rule of law and the Justice Department’s independence.

In another politically sensitive part of his report, Durham found that the FBI did not pursue allegations against Clinton with the same vigor with which they acted against Trump. Clinton’s supporters will however consider that charge as laughable, given that they blame then FBI Director James Comey for swinging the election against her with his public statements on her emails. At the same time, Americans had no idea that Trump was under investigation as well.

The lingering and toxic overhang of the 2016 election does not end there. That fateful presidential race is the trigger for another legal issue still causing political eruptions – the hush money payments made by Trump to adult film actress Stormy Daniels that resulted in him becoming the first ex-president ever to be indicted. The resulting charges over allegedly fraudulent book keeping have already ensured that the campaign for the 2024 election is embroiled in the turbulent first Trump presidential bid seven years ago.

Legal experts criticize Durham

While Republicans highlighted parts of Durham’s report that appeared to validate their own baked in conclusions about what it would say, some legal experts considered it deeply underwhelming.

“It’s a bit of a dud,” Ryan Goodman, an NYU School of Law professor, told CNN’s Erin Burnett, arguing that Durham’s contention that FBI agents had found countervailing evidence that they ignored to upgrade a preliminary probe into Trump into a full-scale investigation was questionable.

Elliot Williams, a CNN legal analyst, said that the report failed to live up to Trump’s accusations. In that Durham did not find “systemic abuses” that Trump partisans had hoped to see.

And McCabe, the FBI’s deputy director at the time of the Trump investigation, said he “vehemently” disagreed with the report and argued it represented a “deep misunderstanding” of what was known at the time. He pointed out that the Trump investigation was launched at a time when Russia was attacking Democratic National Committee servers and had used stolen information to attack Clinton. The investigation was only launched after the bureau received evidence from a friendly foreign government that the Trump campaign had been offered help by the Russians. He said that the FBI would have investigated Clinton under similar circumstances.

In fact, while Durham criticized the FBI for moving to a full scale investigation of Trump, he did state that the bureau did have reason to open a preliminary review. And while he criticized the fact that a full probe was instigated, the outcome of that investigation – which developed into Robert Mueller’s special counsel probe did not bring any criminal charges against Trump. Mueller declined to conclude that Trump’s campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign. He did however detail multiple links between Trump’s campaign and Russians and showed that several senior figures expected to benefit from any intervention in the election by Moscow. And while again laying no charges, Mueller detailed multiple instances of apparent obstruction of justice by Trump.

Democrats are also trying to extract legal capital from the report – specifically from the lack of bombshell accusations of new charges.

Democratic Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois criticized Durham for making “no meaningful recommendations on how the FBI can improve the application of its considerable surveillance authorities in its investigations,” that went beyond the inspector general’s report.

While conservatives criticized the Biden administration over what they claim are politically motivated Justice Department investigations, it was notable that Durham thanked Attorney General Merrick Garland for allowing his investigation to proceed without interference.

But all Trump needed from the report was a headline and a general narrative of suspicion against the FBI. He will do the rest.","A report by special counsel John Durham failed to find evidence of the ""crime of the century"" in the Russia investigation, but still delivered a political payoff for former President Donald Trump. The report criticized the FBI's handling of the 2016 election and called for an official to oversee politically sensitive probes, but did not unveil any new prosecutions or recommendations for further reforms. Trump claimed vindication for his claims of a deep state plot and highlighted the report's criticism of the FBI's use of the Steele dossier. The report's legacy is likely to be political, with perceptions of links between Trump and Russia depending on ideological perspective."
15,"Title: John Shing-wan Leung, American citizen, sentenced to life in prison in China

China has sentenced a 78-year-old U.S. citizen to life in prison for espionage, a court said Monday, but revealed few details about the previously unreported case.

Such heavy terms are relatively rare for foreign citizens in China, and the jailing of American passport holder John Shing-wan Leung is likely to further strain already-damaged ties between Beijing and Washington.

Leung, who is also a Hong Kong permanent resident, ""was found guilty of espionage, sentenced to life imprisonment, deprived of political rights for life,"" said a statement from the Intermediate People's Court in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou.

Suzhou authorities ""took compulsory measures according to the law"" against Leung in April 2021, it said, without specifying when he had been taken into custody.

It was unclear where Leung had been living at the time of his arrest.

A spokesperson for the U.S. embassy in Beijing said they were aware of reports that a American citizen had been recently convicted and sentenced in Suzhou.

""The Department of State has no greater priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas,"" the spokesperson said. ""Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.""

The court statement provided no further details on the charges, and closed-door trials are routine in China for sensitive cases.

Foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin declined to comment further on the case at a regular press briefing on Monday.

In Hong Kong, security minister Chris Tang told a news conference Monday the city's authorities were notified of Leung's arrest in 2021.

""The Hong Kong police have carried out follow-up action according to the notification,"" Tang said, refusing to elaborate further.

The jailing is likely to further damage relations with Washington, which are already severely strained over issues such as trade, human rights and Taiwan.

Washington and Beijing have just ended an unofficial pause in high-level contacts over the United States' shooting down in February of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon.

U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi held eight hours of talks in Vienna in an apparent breakthrough last week, with both sides describing the meeting as ""candid, substantive and constructive"".

On Friday, Washington issued a statement condemning the reported sentencing of a Chinese human rights activist for ""inciting subversion of state power.""

Guo Feixiong, also known as Yang Maodong, was jailed for eight years, according to rights groups. There has been no official confirmation of the sentencing from China.

The U.S. State Department said in its statement its diplomats had been barred from attending the trial in southern China.

""We urge the PRC to live up to its international commitments, give its citizens due process, respect their human rights and fundamental freedoms including freedom of speech, and end the use of arbitrary detentions and exit bans,"" said U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said on Monday the country's ""judicial authorities act in accordance with the law, and their actions brook no interference"".

U.S. President Joe Biden is due to head to Hiroshima for a meeting of leaders of the G7 group of major developed economies.

The G7's relationship with China is expected to be high on the agenda at the May 19-21 summit.

Other high-profile espionage cases in recent years include the arrest in 2019 of Chinese-born Australian writer Yang Jun.

Australia called last week for another of its nationals, jailed journalist Cheng Lei, to be reunited with her family after 1,000 days in detention over ""supplying state secrets overseas"".

In April, authorities formally charged a prominent Chinese journalist with spying, more than a year after he was detained while having lunch at a Beijing restaurant with a Japanese diplomat, a media rights group said.

Also in April, China approved an amendment to its anti-espionage law, broadening its scope by widening the definition of spying and banning the transfer of any data related to what the authorities define as national security.

The changes to the law will come into force on July 1.

""Chinese authorities have long had an essentially free hand in addressing national security concerns,"" Chinese law expert Jeremy Daum wrote.

""The laws involved are sometimes amorphous and vague, leading to selective, or even arbitrary, enforcement,"" he said, adding that the definition of ""espionage"" was already so broad ""it isn't immediately clear what the impact of the expanded definition will be.""","A 78-year-old American citizen and Hong Kong permanent resident, John Shing-wan Leung, has been sentenced to life in prison for espionage in China. The court statement provided no further details on the charges, and closed-door trials are routine in China for sensitive cases.

The 20 best lines from the election episode of Succession

WARNING: This story contains spoilers for Succession season 4, episode 8.

It was presidential election night on Sunday's episode of Succession. That meant a frantic few hours for Matthew Macfadyen's cable news chief Tom Wambsgans... and pretty much every other character on the show, as Jeremy Strong's Kendall, Sarah Snook's Shiv, and Kieran Culkin's Roman collectively sacrificed the notion of democracy in an attempt to achieve their own ambitions. Written by Succession creator Jesse Armstrong, the result was an hour of TV packed with hilarious, dramatic, and pungent dialog. But which bon mots won the night in a manner that Alan Ruck's Connor will never know? Find our selection of the show's best lines below.

Matthew Macfadyen Matthew Macfadyen in 'Succession' | Credit: HBO

""I danced with an old man. He didn't want to dance but they made us dance. He was so confused.""

Greg (Nicholas Braun) tells Tom about his night out with Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård).

""I drank things that aren't normally drinks.""

Another tidbit from Greg about his big night out.

""Information, Greg, it's like a bottle of fine wine. You store it, you hoard it, you save it for a special occasion, and then you smash someone's f---ing face in with it.""

Tom shares some wisdom with Greg.

""It's fun. My team's playing your team. It's only spicy because if my team wins, they're going to shoot your team.""

Roman, who is supporting the Republican candidate Jeryd Mencken (Justin Kirk), to Shiv, who is rooting for the Democrat nominee Daniel Jiménez (Elliot Villar).

""Who watches the Watchmen? I f----ing do!""

Shiv rewrites Watchmen author Alan Moore.

""If I lose, I want it correctly characterized as a huge victory.""

Mencken to Roman.

""Greg, I have to be clear, I have to. If I get drowsy, and I miscall Colorado, instability, right? The US loses credibility, China spots an opportunity, invades Taiwan. Tactical nukes. F---in' s--- goes kablooey and we're back to amoeba. It's a long way back from pond life because you failed to get me a double shot. Okay?""

Tom possibly overstates the importance of Greg getting him a coffee.

""Greg, it's medically good for your brain. It is. What are you saying, all Aztecs are stupid? Don't be a racist little bitch about it, come on.""

Tom tries to persuade Greg to snort some cocaine.

""I want you Gregging for me. You're busted back down to Greg tonight.""

Tom demotes Greg.

""Maybe everyone voted for me. We don't know!""

Connor remains optimistic about his electoral chances.

""So glad I didn't drop out. It just makes an election so much more interesting, when you're in it.""

More from Connor.

""It was complicated, but sometimes you certainly hated him, and you also sort of killed him.""

Tom gets down to brass tacks with Shiv about her relationship with her father.

""Is that even true? Like, is that even true? Or is that like a new position or a tactic? Or what?""

Tom responds poorly to Shiv telling him she's pregnant.

""I spent like a hundred mill here. Couldn't I get a sniff of even a little guy? Organize a little coup down in old Peru? Put me in a van to Tajikistan? Couldn't I just be our fun guy in Uruguay?""

Connor tries to secure an ambassadorship via the power of rhyme.

""I am going to the bathroom to s---. Would you like me to livestream it?""

Roman keeps Shiv in the loop.

""How about I offer for you to keep all your internal organs on your insides rather than I pull them out your a--hole?""

Shiv makes Greg an offer he can't refuse

""Greg! Do not put any more lemon water or wasabi in his eyes, okay?""

Tom warns Greg not to further damage the ocular apparatus of the ATN elections expert (Adam Godley).

""Connor was running for president?""

Frank (Peter Friedman) reacts to Connor's concession speech.

""I f---ing asked you some real questions, Shiv. I wondered why you looked like a goose trying to s--- a house brick, you piece of dirt.""

Kendall reacts to Shiv making a deal with Matsson behind his back.

""Tom, your phone, it's red hot, Tom. A lot of very important people want to scream at you.""

Greg informs his boss about the feedback to ATN calling the election for Mencken.

""Today's action – the FTC's first challenge to a pharmaceutical merger in recent memory – sends a clear signal to the market: The FTC won't hesitate to challenge mergers that enable pharmaceutical conglomerates to entrench their monopolies at the expense of consumers and fair competition,"" said Holly Vedova, agency's bureau of competition director, in a statement. Horizon's share price closed 14% lower Tuesday. Amgen's stock price ended down by more than 2%. Amgen and Horizon, which is based in Ireland, in separate statements said that they believe they will be able to complete the deal by mid-December after responding to the lawsuit in court.

Amgen said that it was ""disappointed"" by the FTC's complaint, and that the company believes it has ""overwhelmingly demonstrated"" that the merger poses no competitive issues. Amgen ""remains committed to completing this acquisition, which will bring significant benefits to patients suffering from very serious rare diseases in the U.S. and around the world,"" the company said. The firm added it has been working ""cooperatively"" to answer questions raised by the FTC's investigative staff over the past several months. Horizon said it ""does not and has no plans"" to engage in cross-marketing bundling. The two drugmakers in February said that the FTC sent them a second request for information about the acquisition as part of the agency's review of the deal. Amgen struck the deal to buy Horizon Therapeutics in early December and had initially said that it expected to complete the sale in the first half of 2023. The purchase would strengthen Amgen's drug portfolio as it prepares to face several patent expirations for key treatments over the next decade. That includes a patent for a medicine that treats psoriasis, an autoimmune condition that causes inflammation of the skin.

18,"Title: Gunman who killed 3 people and injured 6 was 18 years old and used three firearms, police say

CNN —

The 18-year-old gunman who shot and killed three people and wounded six others, including two law enforcement officers, in Farmington, New Mexico, used three guns, the city’s police chief said Monday in a video news statement.

Police Chief Steve Hebbe said the assailant, who was killed by responding officers, used an AR-15-style rifle and two other guns as he roamed a quarter-mile area through a neighborhood Monday morning.

The gunman killed three people, wounded two law enforcement officers and four civilians. He shot at least six houses and three vehicles before he encountered Farmington Police officers shortly after 11 a.m. MDT.

The rampage seems to be random, the chief said.

“There were no schools, no churches, no individuals targeted,” he said, adding the shooter appeared to fire at what “entered his head.”

San Juan Regional Medical Center in Farmington received seven patients, spokesperson Laura Werbner told CNN in an email. Werbner said she could not comment on the patients’ conditions.

The chief said a New Mexico State Police officer who was shot drove himself to the medical center and is still hospitalized.

“He’s doing well at this moment,” Stebbe added.

A Farmington Police officer who was also wounded by gunfire has already been released from the hospital, the chief said.

“The event is difficult to understand, how something like this happens,” he said. “But we are doing the best that we can to piece through (evidence), and talk with family members of the suspect to piece through what was going on” and determine a motive, he added.

The crime scene is “wide and complex” and it will take time to figure out what happened, Stebbe said.

Authorities didn’t identify any victims or the shooter. The chief said police expect to hold another news conference Tuesday afternoon.

The Phoenix division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) earlier tweeted that it was “responding to a report of a mass shooting” in Farmington.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she is praying for the victims and their families and has directed the state to support the investigative efforts of the city and county.

“Although details continue to emerge about this incident, this serves as yet another reminder of how gun violence destroys lives in our state and our country every single day,” she said in a statement. “This administration will not stop fighting the epidemic of gun violence from every angle possible.”

Farmington Mayor Nate Duckett said he has received calls of support from the White House, lawmakers in Washington, the Navajo Nation and mayors throughout the state.

“We are a resilient community, a community that cares for each other,” Duckett said. “In the face of adversity, we must stand together, comfort one another, and make a determined effort to heal these wounds so we can emerge stronger and not allow this act of violence to define us.”

About 46,400 people live in Farmington, which is in northwestern New Mexico, just south of the Colorado state line. It is about 150 miles northwest of Albuquerque and about 50 miles from the Four Corners area where the borders of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah intersect.","An 18-year-old gunman used three firearms, including an AR-15-style rifle, to kill three people and injure six others, including two law enforcement officers, in Farmington, New Mexico. The shooting appeared to be random, with no specific targets. The shooter was killed by responding officers. The crime scene is complex and authorities are still investigating to determine a motive. The governor of New Mexico has expressed her condolences and support for the investigation."
19,"Title: Turkish President Erdogan heads to a runoff election that will decide who leads a key NATO country

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is locked in a tight election race, with a make-or-break runoff against his main challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu. (May 15)

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is locked in a tight election race, with a make-or-break runoff against his main challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu. (May 15)

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkish voters will head back to the polls in two weeks for a runoff election to decide if conservative President Recep Tayyip Erdogan or his main rival will lead a country struggling with sky-high inflation as it plays a key role in NATO expansion and in the Middle East.

The May 28 second round of presidential elections that election officials announced Monday will allow Turkey to decide if the nation remains under the increasingly authoritarian president for a third decade, or if it can embark on the more democratic course that Kemal Kilicdaroglu has claimed he can deliver.

As in previous years, the nationalist Erdogan led a highly divisive campaign.

He portrayed Kilicdaroglu, who had received the backing of the country’s pro-Kurdish party, of colluding with “terrorists” and of supporting what he called “deviant” LGBTQ rights. As a devout leader of the predominantly Muslim country, which was founded on secular principles, Erdogan has had the backing of conservative voters and has courted more Islamists with his anti-LGBTQ rhetoric.

In a bid to woo voters hit hard by inflation, he increased wages and pensions and subsidized electricity and gas bills, while showcasing Turkey’s homegrown defense industry and infrastructure projects.

Some voters said the results announced Monday should strengthen Turkish democracy by reminding Erdogan of the important of convincing voters.

Sena Dayan said she voted for the Erdogan alliance, but wasn’t upset at the need for a runoff.

“I believe this is good for the government, and better for our future, to look back at mistaken decisions,” Dayan said in Istanbul. “Erdogan is too confident in himself. The people broke this confidence a bit.”

For others, Sunday’s vote showed how polarized Turkey has become.

“I am not happy at all,” voter Suzan Devletsah said. “I worry about the future of Turkey.”

Kilicdaroglu leads the pro-secular main opposition party, which was established by the founder of modern Turkey. He campaigned on promises to reverse crackdowns on free speech and other forms of democratic backsliding and to repair an economy battered by high inflation and currency devaluation.

The latest official statistics put inflation at about 44%, down from a high of around 86%, but independent experts estimate them as much higher.

As the results came in, it appeared those elements didn’t shake up the electorate as many expected. Turkey’s conservative heartland overwhelmingly voted for the ruling party, with Kilicdaroglu’s main opposition winning most of the coastal provinces in the west and south.

Western nations and foreign investors were particularly interested in the outcome because of Erdogan’s unorthodox leadership of the economy, and often mercurial but successful efforts to put the country that spans Europe and Asia at the center of many major diplomatic negotiations.

Erdogan faced electoral headwinds due to the cost-of-living crisis and criticism over the government’s response to a devastating February earthquake. But with his alliance retaining its hold on the parliament, Erdogan is now in a good position to win in the second round.

Preliminary results showed that Erdogan won 49.5% of the vote on Sunday, while Kilicdaroglu grabbed 44.9%, and the third candidate, Sinan Ogan, received 5.2%, according to Ahmet Yener, the head of Supreme Electoral Board.

The remaining uncounted votes were not enough to tip Erdogan into outright victory, even if they all broke for him, Yener said. In the last presidential election in 2018, Erdogan won in the first round, with more than 52% of the vote.

Uncertainty looms for the 3.4 million Syrian refugees who have been under Turkey’s temporary protection after fleeing the war in neighboring Syria. Both Kilicdaroglu and Ogan campaigned on sending Syrians back, arguing that they’re a burden as Turkey faces an economic downturn, and Syrian President Bashar Assad and Erdogan’s governments are working on improving relations after years of hostility. Erdogan, who welcomed Syrians to Turkey, has put them and other migrants on the table in negotiations with Europe, which has been wrangling with the flow of people.

Erdogan, who has governed Turkey as either prime minister or president since 2003, painted Sunday’s vote as a victory both for himself and the country.

In a tweet Monday, he said the votes for him and his alliance confirmed the nation’s trust but added he respected the results that kept him from an outright victory by half a percentage point.

“God willing we will have a historic win by increasing our votes from May 14 and emerging victorious on May 28 elections,” he said as he added he would seek votes from all people regardless of their political preferences.

Kilicdaroglu sounded defiant, tweeting around the time the runoff was announced: “Do not fall into despair ... We will stand up and win this election together.”

Kilicdaroglu, 74, and his party have lost all previous presidential and parliamentary elections since he took leadership in 2010 but increased their votes this time.

Right-wing candidate Ogan has not said whom he would endorse if the elections go to a second round.

Erdogan’s party and its allies secured 322 seats in the National Assembly, while the opposition won 213 and the 65 remaining went to a pro-Kurdish and leftist alliance, according to preliminary results.

Results reported by the state-run Anadolu Agency showed Erdogan’s party dominating in the earthquake-hit region, winning 10 out of 11 provinces in an area that has traditionally supported the president. That was despite criticism of a slow response by his government to the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that killed more than 50,000 people.

Nearly 89% of eligible voters in Turkey cast a ballot and over half of overseas voters went to the ballot box. Voter turnout in Turkey is traditionally strong, despite the government suppressing freedom of expression and assembly over the years and especially since a 2016 coup attempt.

Erdogan blamed the failed coup on followers of a former ally, cleric Fethullah Gulen, and initiated a large-scale crackdown on civil servants with alleged links to Gulen and also jailed activists, journalists and pro-Kurdish politicians.

Michael Georg Link, Special Co-ordinator and leader of the OSCE observer mission monitoring the election, said the elections were competitive but limited.

“As the criminalization of some political forces, including the detention of several opposition politicians, prevented full political pluralism and impeded individuals’ rights to run in the elections,” he explained.

The observer mission also noted the use of public resources, media bias in favor of Erdogan, the criminalization of disseminating false information and online censorship gave Erdogan an “unjustified advantage,” while saying the elections showed the resilience of Turkish democracy.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Shrines present numerous challenges. Some will test your mettle in combat, while others can stump your brain due to puzzle mechanics. Here's our guide to help you with the Shrine locations in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Shrine locations

Shrine functions, rewards, and challenges

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Shrines are akin to what you've seen before if you've played Breath of the Wild. They dot the entire countryside, and you can tackle them as you go along. They also act as fast travel points, speeding up the exploration. Moreover, you'll find Shrines in the Sky region, too. We also recommend getting the Purah Pad Sensor, since this will track and ping you whenever a Shrine is nearby.

Completing a Shrine challenge/task will net you a Blessing of Light. Once you have four of these orbs, you can talk to a Goddess Statue to choose a reward. You can pick either a single heart or a stamina segment.

Shrine challenges can be divided into the following categories:

Puzzles - By far the most plentiful, these will make use of various Zonai Devices and abilities, as well as your wit and creativity, as you try to reach the end goal.

- By far the most plentiful, these will make use of various Zonai Devices and abilities, as well as your wit and creativity, as you try to reach the end goal. Combat Training - These will teach you the basic mechanics. However, do take note that the open-world nature of the game means that you might only discover these mini-tutorials later.

Only then will the Shrine itself actually spawn. That Shrine may have its own challenge, or just Rauru's Blessing for a quick reward. Some examples of Shrine Quest objectives include:

Sky Crystals - Bring the green crystal to the pedestal. Time Trial - Pass through the green rings within the time limit. Light and Mirror Puzzles - Use Zonai Mirrors to reflect the beam of light to the target. Riddles - Hear a riddle about a Shrine's possible location. Labyrinths - Some Shrines can only be found in the Surface and Sky Labyrinths, which are maze-like mini-dungeons.

- As you explore, you might find Shrine Quests that need to be completed. Only then will the Shrine itself actually spawn. That Shrine may have its own challenge, or just Rauru's Blessing for a quick reward. Some examples of Shrine Quest objectives include:

One more important concept to note is that the Depths World does not have any Shrines. However, Shrine locations in the Surface region correspond to Lightroot locations in the Depths, and vice versa. In fact, if you open the world map and look at a Surface Shrine, say, ""Mayachin,"" and then open the Depths map, you'll notice that the name is just reversed/mirrored: ""Nihcayam Lightroot."" In short: any Shrine you find will have an equivalent Lightroot in the Depths below; any Lightroot you find in the Depths will have a Shrine above.

You can breathe a sigh of relief if you enter a Rauru's Blessing Shrine.

Shrine maps: Surface World

For our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Shrines guide, we've opted to divide the Surface World into north and south portions. However, due to the layout of the game world, we've categorized them per region.

We'll also add some general info on what you can expect in the Shrine itself. In some cases, due to the complexity or trickiness of puzzles, that Shrine may have its own guide.

21,"Title: Biden plans to nominate Dr. Monica Bertagnolli at NIH

President Joe Biden said Monday he intends to nominate a new director for the National Institutes of Health.

Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, a surgical oncologist and cancer researcher, was picked by Biden as the successor to Francis Collins.

""Dr. Bertagnolli has spent her career pioneering scientific discovery and pushing the boundaries of what is possible to improve cancer prevention and treatment for patients, and ensuring that patients in every community have access to quality care,"" Biden said in a statement. ""As Director of the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Bertagnolli has advanced my Cancer Moonshot to end cancer as we know it.""

The statement continued, ""She has brought together partners and resources from different sectors to launch groundbreaking efforts in cancer prevention and early detection, a national navigation program for childhood cancers, and additional programs to bring clinical trials to more Americans. Dr. Bertagnolli is a world-class physician-scientist whose vision and leadership will ensure NIH continues to be an engine of innovation to improve the health of the American people.""

Bertagnolli will be the second woman as NIH director if her nomination is confirmed. She will replace Collins, who left the agency in December 2021 after 12 years with the agency. Lawrence Tabak has been serving as interim director while Biden searches for a new pick.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra released a statement congratulating Bertagnolli on her nomination.

""I congratulate Dr. Bertagnolli on her nomination to lead the NIH,"" the statement read. Her storied scientific career has advanced our nation's understanding of diseases such as cancer and established her as one of the top scientists in the world. She is one of the most powerful voices in the country for cancer patients, particularly for those in rural and remote communities.""

According to her biography on the White House website, Bertagnolli grew up on a ranch in Wyoming before attending Princeton University for undergraduate studies and the University of Utah for graduate studies.

Previously, Bertagnoli was a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School, a surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and a member of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Treatment and Sarcoma Centers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

In December 2022, Bertagnolli announced that she was diagnosed with early breast cancer but her prognosis was ""favorable.""

""Having been an oncologist my entire career, it was always -- and still is -- all about the patients and survivors,"" she said. ""It's one thing to know about cancer as a physician, but it is another to experience it firsthand as a patient as well. To anyone with cancer today: I am truly in this together with you.""

23,"Title: Mormon church has $100bn ‘clandestine hedge fund’, says whistleblower

A former investment manager for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints says that the organization stockpiled more than $100bn in funding intended for charity work but never spent it on such projects.

“It was really a clandestine hedge fund,” David A Nielsen said during an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes. “Once the money went in, it didn’t go out.”

Nielsen, who submitted a complaint to the Internal Revenue Service in 2019, previously managed the church’s investment arm, Ensign Peak Advisors, for nine years.

A report on the complaint to the top US tax authority was published by the Washington Post in 2019 after Nielsen’s brother provided a copy.

Nielsen, a devout Mormon himself, was first recruited to work for Ensign Peak while working on Wall Street.

Nielsen said that during his time with Ensign Peak, he observed the church’s investment firm “[masquerading] as a charity”, dodging what would be billions of dollars in taxes by falsifying records, and generally misleading other believers of the Mormon faith.

Every year, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints collected an estimated $7bn from its 17 million members through a practice known as tithing, in which members give about 10% of their income to the religious organization.

About $1bn of the collected money was placed into a reserve fund at Ensign Peak – which is registered as a non-profit – and invested, with profits growing tax-free.

Created in 1997, the reserve fund has ballooned to more than $100bn, which is nearly twice the size of Harvard’s endowment, Nielsen said.

“I thought we were going to change the world,” Nielsen remarked. “We just grew the bank account.”

Records show that money from the church’s reserve fund was used to support for-profit initiatives, including a Salt Lake City mall built on church land and a church-owned insurance company.

Nielsen resigned in 2019 after a website named Mormon Leaks linked church members to shell companies that held billions of dollars in stocks and bonds, assets that were actually controlled by Ensign Peak.

After his resignation, Nielsen filed a 74-page whistleblower complaint to the IRS that accused Ensign Peak of violating its tax-exempt status by directing money to for-profit businesses.

Nielsen’s complaint was later forwarded to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said the church took great lengths to hide the size of its investments through shell companies and fake office addresses, the Washington Post reported.

The church paid $5m to resolve its SEC case in February.

The Mormon church official W Christopher Waddell, who oversees the organization’s financial, real estate, investment and charitable operations as the first counselor in the presiding bishopric, vehemently denied Nielsen’s accusations.

“Flat-out wrong,” said Waddell, who added that Ensign Peak acted as “the church’s treasury” and provided resources for its operation.

Nielsen’s interview with 60 Minutes is one of the first times he has given public comment on the report.

“We gave the IRS and the SEC all the professional courtesy,” Nielsen said. “This is just too important to fall through the cracks.”

But experts say that the likelihood of the IRS investigating Nielsen’s claims is low.

“The political risk is so great that it comes with real danger,” former IRS official Phil Hackney said during the 60 Minutes segment. “At the same time, there’s a real risk to the rule of law if the IRS doesn’t come in and enforce those rules.”","A former investment manager for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, David A Nielsen, has claimed that the church stockpiled over $100bn in funding intended for charity work but never spent it on such projects.

24,"Title: Shannon Sharpe tees off on Ja Morant apologists after latest gun incident: ‘I’m mad’

Shannon Sharpe wasn't upset or surprised by Ja Morant's second incident brandishing an apparent gun in an Instagram Live video that went viral early Sunday morning.

After Morant's first gun incident in March, Sharpe declared that it was going to be actions that changed the tenor on the star Grizzlies point guard. So when Sharpe spoke on his morning debate show ""Undisputed"" on Monday morning, he focused his attention to the fans and people around Morant.

""I'm mad, I'm upset, I'm disgusted by the people that defended (Morant),"" Sharpe said. ""Because that's what got us here.""

JA MORANT REACTION:ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski says Ja Morant could face a lengthy suspension after gun video

Sharpe went on to describe how people attacked him for critical comments on Morant in March. Other media pundits, including Stephen A. Smith, were skeptical about how quickly Morant returned to the Grizzlies after the team announced he was taking time away on March 4. Morant missed eight games due to an NBA suspension, but six of those games were before the NBA's announcement.

Morant's last suspension had an indirect impact on his chances of making an All-NBA team. Since he didn't qualify, Morant missed out on a chance to make more than $39 million dollars in additional money on his five-year contract extension he recently signed.

Now, Sharpe thinks that $39 million isn't the only money Morant is likely to lose, and he blaming people whom he feels enabled Morant.

""All of the people that said let Ja be Ja, are y'all gonna be the treasurer of that GoFundMe account, because he just lost $39 million because he wasn't on one of the three All-NBA teams,"" Sharpe said. ""He's about to lose another $20-$30 million of these endorsements.""

""What about to the NBA? What about the Nike? What about the Powerade? I want to know who is going to be the treasurer of that GoFundMe because he is about to lose that NBA contract. He is about to lose that Powerade endorsement.""

Morant was suspended from Grizzlies team activities after the video surfaced Sunday while the NBA looks into the matter.

25,"Title: Elon Musk still needs 'Twitter sitter,' judges rule

Tesla CEO Elon Musk lost an appeal to unwind parts of a consent decree that he and the automaker struck with the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle civil securities fraud charges in 2018.

The ruling, issued Monday by a federal appeals court, affirms a prior decision from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which issued the initial denial.

Musk has litigated with the SEC for years over the consent decree, which was revised in 2019 after the SEC charged Musk with making ""false and misleading"" statements in his August 2018 ""funding secured"" tweets. The Tesla CEO said he had found a buyer to take the automaker private at $420 a share, a claim which a federal judge later found to be false.

The agreement required ""pre-approval"" for tweets by Musk that contained information material to Tesla, and which extended to ""certain senior executives,"" according to the judgment.

A February letter from Musk attorney Alex Spiro said the terms of the consent decree amounted to ""unconstitutional"" infringement of his free-speech rights.

But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed those claims, writing that the court saw ""no evidence to support Musk's contention that the SEC has used the consent decree to conduct bad-faith, harassing investigations of his protected speech.""

The court noted that the SEC had opened ""just three inquiries"" into his tweets since 2018: over his ""funding secured"" tweet, a tweet that misstated Tesla's annual production numbers, and a Twitter poll where Musk proposed selling 10% of his Tesla shares, according to the court filing.

Far from the investigations being in ""bad-faith,"" the court wrote that ""each tweet plausibly violated the terms of the consent decree.""

Musk's attorneys also put forward an argument under Rule 60(b), which allows a party to reopen their case if the law or the situation has changed significantly. Musk's legal team argued that the SEC's methods of enforcement made compliance ""substantially more onerous.""

But the court dismissed that argument as well, noting that Musk was merely required to consult with Tesla's general counsel or an in-house securities lawyer.

Musk's Twitter activity has been the subject of both SEC and shareholder attention. Musk was found ""not liable"" in a February securities fraud trial over his ""funding secured"" tweets. Musk has also been fending off a lawsuit involving his public boosting of the cryptocurrency dogecoin.

The court added that if Musk had concerns about SEC oversight over his ""right to tweet without even limited internal oversight,"" he could have defended himself against the SEC's charges or negotiated a different settlement. ""But he chose not to do so,"" the court emphasized.

""Having made that choice,"" the court concluded, Musk's team couldn't argue ""to collaterally reopen a final judgment merely because he has now changed his mind.""

""We will seek further review and continue to bring attention to the important issue of the government constraint on speech,"" Musk's attorney Spiro said in a statement to CNBC.

Read the judgment below:","Elon Musk has lost an appeal to unwind parts of a consent decree with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to settle civil securities fraud charges in 2018. The decree required ""pre-approval"" for tweets by Musk that contained information material to Tesla.

The Voice has named Blake Shelton’s successor.

Country music superstar Reba McEntire — one of TVLine readers’ top picks to succeed Shelton — will serve as a coach during Season 24. She’ll be joined by Niall Horan (returning for his second consecutive season as coach), John Legend (returning after a one-season break) and Gwen Stefani (who last served as a coach during Season 22).

That means that neither Kelly Clarkson (who has coached Seasons 14-21 and 23) nor Chance the Rapper (who made his debut alongside Horan for Season 23) are returning to the NBC reality competition this fall.

McEntire has a long history with The Voice, having served as Shelton’s first-ever team advisor back in Season 1, briefly coached contestants during Season 8, and served as Mega Mentor during Season 23 — but this will be the first time she stakes claim to a red chair.

Shelton announced last October that he’d be leaving The Voice after its current cycle (which wraps with a two-night finale airing Monday, May 22 and Tuesday, May 23). He was one of the four original coaches when the series premiered on NBC in 2011, along with Christina Aguilera, CeeLo Green and Adam Levine. Green left after Season 5, and Aguilera left after Season 10. Levine stuck around until Season 16, exiting the show in 2019.

Shelton has coached every season of The Voice so far, with eight of his vocalists winning the grand prize.

It seems like a not-so-good year for Ben Affleck’s career as his latest project is expected to emerge as another box-office flop. Directed by Robert Rodriguez, Hypnotic stars Affleck as Danny Rourke, a detective on the lookout for a sinister criminal who possesses the ability to manipulate minds.

The cast includes Alice Braga, Jackie Earle Haley, Jeff Fahey, and William Fichtner. As per Deadline, the production reportedly cost around $70 million, and unfortunately, experts predict only a meager opening weekend profit of $2.5 million by the end of Sunday.

Ben Affleck Hits Two Box-Office Flops In A Row This 2023

Hypnotic is not the first Affleck project to fail at the box office, as April’s Air only managed to earn $85.5 million against a budget of $90 million. However, the film was originally made as a Prime Video exclusive, and the profit it gained from the box office was still considered a win for Amazon Studios.

The latest movie’s case seems already hopeless as new reviews continue to criticize the franchise. Hypnotic is certified rotten with a 39% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. This puts the actor’s career in a critical situation, as his last two projects, The Last Duel and Deep Water, were also poorly received by fans.

Meanwhile, Affleck’s wife, Jennifer Lopez, stars in a new thriller movie entitled Mother, which premiered on Netflix over the weekend. The singer-actress portrayed an ex-special forces parent and reclusive assassin who comes out of hiding to protect her daughter from danger.

The responses were a mixed bag of fair reviews, although critics and fans compliment Lopez for personifying a strong character. Her presence in the movie is evidently what attracted global attention.

Affleck’s next appearance will be in The Flash starring Ezra Miller which will premiere next month. The film has been peppered with controversy following the lead star’s erratic behavior. Affleck will reprise his role as the iconic Batman, together with Michael Keaton, who will portray another version of the famed superhero.

Could DC’s The Flash Save Ben Affleck’s Career?

It might not be the worst year for Ben Affleck despite two of his projects failing to perform at the box office. The Flash could be his redeeming chance as the DC film becomes one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2023. It has a budget of around $220 million, with a possibility of crossing the $1 billion mark due to its rigorous marketing and star-studded cast.

Hopefully, the upcoming DC film won’t suffer the same fate that happened to 2017’s Justice League. The Flash has a relatively smaller budget and is not going up against any major competing franchises. If the movie emerges victorious at the global box office arena, it will save Affleck’s year from the ashes of Air and Hypnotic.

The Flash arrives in theaters on June 16, 2023.

28,"Title: The stock market will struggle to rally until these 2 big fears are put to rest

So much for the stock-market climbing the proverbial wall of worry.

The S&P 500 index continues to struggle in a tight range and some analysts see little prospect for a breakout until two, very big worries are in the rearview mirror.

No surprise, the culprits are the persistent worries about regional U.S. banks following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March and the subsequent demise of First Republic Bank, along with the latest debt-ceiling showdown in Washington that threatens to tip the federal government into a first-ever default in early June.

‘Capping’ rallies

For now, those concerns can be described as “capping” rallies rather than “resulting in a downdraft,” Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.

But if more banks look in danger of failing or if the path to a debt-ceiling deal gets more rocky, investors should be prepared for a significant, but “buyable,” pullback, she said.

Need to Know: Why the stock market has actually thrived as regional banks flounder

Meanwhile, investors appear content to pile into tech stocks, particularly the biggest of the so-called megacap names, in something of a flight to safety that has sparked separate concerns over the durability of the stock market’s 2023 rally.

The S&P 500 SPX, +0.30% fell 0.3% last week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.14% dropped 1.1%. The S&P 500’s decline was cushioned by megacap tech-related stocks, which also helped lift the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.66% out of a bear market, gaining 0.4% last week.

Stocks were flat to modestly higher Monday afternoon.

Bank worries

What are investors worried about when it comes to the banks? The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF KRE, +3.16% fell more than 5% in the past week as the sector was led lower by a renewed fall in shares of Pacwest Bancorp PACW, +17.58% , helping sour the tone for the broader market.

See: The regional-bank crisis did not appear over on Thursday

While the 2007-2009 financial crisis was driven by fears of insolvent banks, the problem for regional banks is centered on liquidity, said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a Friday note. That means fears of “contagion” aren’t in play. Instead, the worry is economic.

“If banks are worried about deposit runs, they will keep more capital in reserve than they normally would. That reduces the available pool of capital to make loans,” Essaye wrote.

“Additionally, if banks think their regulatory costs will increase (and they absolutely will) or regulators are going to deeply investigate their operations, they’ll hold even more capital in reserve, further reducing the capital available for loans. The result could be a widespread reduction in lending in the economy,” he said.

In other words, a credit crunch.

Debt-ceiling showdown

Meanwhile, the stock market appears for now to be looking past the debt-ceiling drama in Washington. The second round of debt-ceiling talks between the White House and congressional leaders appears set for Tuesday, President Joe Biden said Sunday.

Biden called himself optimistic, while House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Monday said the White House and congressional Republicans remained “far apart” on terms of a deal.

Debt ceiling standoff: With key meeting expected Tuesday, here’s what could go into a bipartisan deal

That said, volatility in the usually sleepy market for Treasury bills and a sharp rise in the cost of insuring U.S. government debt against default using derivative instruments known as credit-default swaps shows investors aren’t without unease.

The stakes are high. A brief default would deliver a hit to U.S. real gross domestic product, could cost almost 2 million jobs, and send the unemployment rate toward 5%, iCapital estimates. The stock market isn’t positioned for that kind of economic hit nor for the potential rise in volatility, Amoroso said.

Given a history of brinkmanship around debt-ceiling talks, there’s a strong chance talks go down to the 11th hour. If so, it isn’t hard to imagine a late breakdown that sparks an equity pullback of around 5% or so, she said, while a prolonged impasse could see a drop of as much as 10%.

“I think the biggest thing investors shouldn’t do right now is try to chase the market,” Amoroso said, arguing that a pullback would likely prove to be “buyable.”

Tech concentration

Meanwhile, what should investors make of resurgent tech-related stocks?

The top 10 stocks hold a 29% weight in the S&P 500, and are responsible for around 70% of year-to-date performance, said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird, in a Thursday note. Within that top 10, seven of the leaders are “Big Tech” stocks, including the five largest, with Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.29% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.16% alone accounting for roughly 14% of the entire S&P 500.

In One Chart: The S&P 500 is top-heavy with tech. Here’s what that says about future stock-market returns.

Narrow concentration, or a lack of “breadth,” can make investors nervous.

A handful of names leading the market “is never considered healthy when there’s vast underlying weakness,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, in a note.

But Krosby and others said the current setup is less a cause for alarm. With markets and the Federal Reserve attempting to make sense of a number of inconsistent signals, it makes sense for big tech to serve as a defensive stronghold, she wrote.

Amoroso at iCapital agreed. “There’s a lack of compelling opportunities, which presents one big compelling opportunity [in tech] because of secular growth, fortress balance sheets and little interest-rate exposure,” she said.

Krosby said that as worries overhanging the market begin to unwind, it would be helpful, and expected, to see other sectors, along with small- and midcap stocks, play catch-up.

Economic data and earnings releases in the week ahead could help broaden market leadership, she said, while positive developments around the debt ceiling would help underpin market sentiment.

“Until then, the market will have to contend with a case of bad breadth,” Krosby said.","The S&P 500 index is struggling to rally due to two major concerns: the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March, and the subsequent demise of First Republic Bank, along with the latest debt-ceiling showdown in Washington. These concerns are ""capping"" rallies rather than resulting in a downdraft, but if more banks look in danger of failing or if the path to a debt-ceiling deal gets more rocky, investors should be prepared for a significant, but ""buyable,"" pullback. Meanwhile, investors are piling into tech stocks, particularly the biggest of the so-called megacap names, in something of a flight to safety that has sparked separate concerns over the durability of the stock market's 2023 rally."

A painting by the British street artist Banksy which showed a gymnast waving a ribbon in the air was removed from a destroyed building in Irpin, Ukraine, and moved to a different location within the same city, according to Ukrainian state media Ukrinform.

""We dismantled Banksy's painting from the destroyed nine-story building. Later, it [the building] will be completely demolished, and we will design something else in its place,"" said Irpin Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, according to Ukrinform. The mayor attended the event where it was dismantled, Ukrinform reported.

The mural and a segment of the wall it was attached to was dismantled from Severynivska Street and placed in the new location over a period of two weeks, according to the Ukrainian news agency.

Ukrinform said the mural is now in a metal frame to preserve the image and the whole structure weighs 7.5 tons.

""It was important for us to preserve the large fragment of the installation so that future generations would look at this work not as an artistic piece, but as a work that puts many social and political emphases,"" Zoriana Tikhonchuk, head of the Architecture and Urbanism Committee at the Irpin Reconstruction Summit said as reported by Ukrinform.

Irpin’s mayor added that they plan to create Ukraine's first Contemporary Art Square at the site where the exhibit was moved, Ukrinform said.

""We want to create a Contemporary Art Square, where this Banksy drawing will be the centerpiece. We plan to build a large three-meter concrete fence around the perimeter. We will attract artists from Europe who paint in the style of Banksy,"" Markushyn said, according to Ukrinform.

Ukrinform added that the art square will be presented to residents in the near future and there will be constant security and video surveillance in the exhibit’s new location.

The mural is one of several works completed by the British street artist in cities across Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, following Russia’s invasion.

Earlier this year, a ringleader of a group that allegedly tried to steal a Banksy mural from a wall in Ukraine could face up to 12 years in prison. The painting depicted a woman in a gas mask carrying a fire extinguisher.

According to police, the group removed the mural from a wall and had intended to transport it from the site using wooden planks. The suspects, who hail from Kyiv and the central Ukrainian city of Cherkasy, were “detained on the spot,” the head of the Kyiv region military administration, Oleksii Kuleba, said at the time of their arrest in early December.","A Banksy mural depicting a gymnast waving a ribbon was removed from a destroyed building in Irpin, Ukraine and moved to a new location within the same city.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has a day-one item duplication glitch that lets you make copies of new weapons and shields. It’s a handy exploit that’s easy to do and can cut down on a lot of the headaches that stem from the Breath of the Wild sequel’s weapon degradation system.

Gear breaking in Tears of the Kingdom isn’t quite as frustrating as the first game thanks to a new fuse ability that lets you combine weapons to increase durability and strength. A recently discovered item duplication glitch makes it even less of a worry. It was found by Twitter user Modoki_returns and shared on YouTube in a video by BLAINES and it’s pretty simple to grasp.

Like a lot of item duplication glitches in Nintendo Switch games, it revolves around some menu trickery. Basically any new melee weapon, bow, or shield you discover for the first time can be duplicated in just a few steps, yielding a second copy you can start using once the first breaks.

How to duplicate weapons in Zelda: Tears of the the Kingdom

Make room in your inventory . Remove the weapon, shield, or bow you have equipped . Pick up a shield or weapon with an “???” symbol. When the info message is displayed press the start/plus button to open your inventory screen. Press Y to sort the items. Equip the item in the last slot . Leave the inventory screen. Open the inventory screen back up and drop the item you had equipped . Pick it back up. It should now be a copy of the new item you previously picked up.

The glitch will only work if the weapon you’re equipping and dropping is the last slit in your inventory. so it helps to have a weak item on hand that will always take up that slot . You can also re-load your most recent save if you accidently pick up a new powerful piece of equipment for the first time and forget to use the exploit.



Players have been using it to clone the 70 strength Royal Shield found near the start of the game, but it’s helpful on everything. The only big drawback right now is that there doesn’t seem to be a way to get it to work with items found in treasure chests. So it can’t give you a second Hyrulean Shield, for example.

All-in-all, it’s not to dissimilar from the item duplication glitches in Breath of the Wild, or the ones people were using to clone stuff in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. The current method isn’t quite as robust as those, but its ease of use makes it a huge time saver. We’ll see how soon Nintendo ends up patching it, and if players can discover an even better duplication exploit before then.

Update 5/15/2023 9:05 a.m. ET: Added more specific details on how the glitch works.

32,"Title: Debt limit: Biden expected to meet with Hill leaders Tuesday following 'productive' meetings among staff

CNN —

President Joe Biden is expected to meet Tuesday with congressional leaders on the debt ceiling limit following “productive” staff-level negotiations over the weekend, two sources familiar with the talks told CNN on Sunday, as the US barrels toward a deadline that could come as soon as June 1.

Negotiators have been able to pinpoint some areas on which congressional staff and the White House can find common ground, including revising the permitting process, rescinding unspent Covid-19 relief funds and potentially cutting spending, the sources said.

Biden and the top four congressional leaders – House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell – held talks on the debt limit last week in the Oval Office. Tuesday’s meeting, which has not yet been officially confirmed, according to the sources, comes after a planned Friday meeting was postponed as the staff-level talks continued.

Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that talks between the two sides have been “constructive.”

Biden, Adeyamo said, “looks forward to getting together with the leaders to talk about how we continue to make progress.”

Biden himself indicated on Sunday that he expected principal-level debt ceiling discussions to take place Tuesday.

“We’re working on it right now,” he said in brief remarks to reporters as he completed a bike ride in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

There is still not a clear path forward to avoid a default with just four more days before June 1 when both the House and Senate are scheduled to be in session. Biden also confirmed Sunday that he expects to depart Wednesday for Hiroshima, Japan, for the G7 summit.

“That’s my plan as it stands now,” he told reporters in Rehoboth Beach.

It’s become increasingly clear that some spending cuts must be included for a deal to materialize, one of the sources said, and that point of discussion has been the main sticking point in negotiations so far.

Biden said Sunday that he was waiting to hear Republicans’ exact proposals on work requirements for certain government aid programs. He said he has voted in the past for “tougher aid programs” that are now law but “for Medicaid, it’s a different story.”

White House spokesperson Michael Kikukawa later elaborated on the president’s answer, saying in a statement that Biden would evaluate the GOP proposals guided by the principle that they would “not take away people’s health coverage” or “push Americans into poverty.”

Negotiators recognize they will likely need to have an outline of a deal by the end of the week to ensure a bill can pass through Congress by June 1, the sources said, but they also think there are potential congressional tools that can be used to speed up the process if needed. The sources did not specify what those tools are.

Adeyemo reiterated Sunday that the US “can’t” default on its debt but declined to provide details on areas of agreement. He echoed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s assessment that default could happen “as early as June 1” but said it “can be sometime in early June,” calling on Congress to act as he warned that default would be “catastrophic.”

Pressed by Bash on the timing of a deal following McCarthy’s call for an agreement in principle by early this week and business leaders like JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon warning of market panic in the absence of a deal, Adeyemo said Biden “believes we should raise the debt limit as soon as possible.”

“Because it’s not only financial markets, but the (University of Michigan) survey of consumer sentiment last week showed that consumers are now worried about the debt limit – it’s affecting the way they’re spending,” Adeyemo said.

Meanwhile, top Biden economic adviser Lael Brainard on Sunday echoed previous White House comments on preferring a whole deal rather than a short-term fix.

“Short-term is not a fix. It is not really addressing that core uncertainty that CEOs are talking about. It’s just really important to take default and address it, and Congress has the tools to do that,” the director of the National Economic Council said on “Face the Nation” on CBS.

Biden expressed optimism Sunday for an eventual agreement.

“I remain optimistic because I’m a congenital optimist. But I really think there’s a desire on their part, as well as ours, to reach an agreement. I think we’ll be able to do it,” he said in Rehoboth Beach.

The president had indicated last week that he was prepared for talks to go down to the wire.

“I’ve been involved in negotiations my whole career,” he told CNN during a trip to New York. “Some negotiations happen at the last second, some negotiations happen way ahead of time. So, we’ll see.”

Biden resurfaced last week the controversial idea of lifting the borrowing cap without Congress by invoking the 14th Amendment, which some legal experts argue gives the president the authority to order the nation’s debts to be paid regardless of the debt limit Congress sets.

But using the 14th Amendment to let the Treasury Department borrow above the debt ceiling to pay the nation’s obligations would almost certainly prompt a constitutional crisis and swift legal action.

Asked Sunday whether the administration would consider invoking the 14th Amendment in the absence of a deal with Congress, Adeyemo said, “What the president said was that he did not think the 14th Amendment would solve our problems now. The only thing that can solve our problems now is for Congress to lift the debt limit.”

This story and headline have been updated.","President Joe Biden is expected to meet with congressional leaders on Tuesday to discuss the debt ceiling limit, following productive staff-level negotiations over the weekend.

33,"Title: EPA finally wakes up with stiff new climate rules: ‘They’ve hit full throttle’

The sleeping giant of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has stirred.

In the past month, an avalanche of anti-pollution rules, targeting everything from toxic drinking water to planet-heating gases in the atmosphere, have been issued by the agency. Belatedly, the sizable weight of the US federal government is being thrown at longstanding environmental crises, including the climate emergency.

On Thursday, the EPA’s month of frenzied activity was crowned by the toughest ever limits upon carbon pollution from America’s power sector, with large, existing coal and gas plants told they must slash their emissions by 90% or face being shut down.

The measure will, the EPA says, wipe out more than 600m tons of carbon emissions over the next two decades, about double what the entire UK emits each year. But even this wasn’t the biggest pollution reduction announced in recent weeks.

In April, new emissions standards for cars and trucks will eliminate an expected 9bn tons of CO 2 by the mid-point of the century, while separate rules issued late last year aim to slash hydrofluorocarbons, planet-heating gases used widely in refrigeration and air conditioning, by 4.6bn tons in the same timeframe. Methane, another highly potent greenhouse gas, will be curtailed by 810m tons over the next decade in another EPA edict.

In just a few short months the EPA, diminished and demoralized under Donald Trump, has flexed its regulatory muscles to the extent that 15bn tons of greenhouse gases – equivalent to about three times the US’s carbon pollution, or nearly half of the entire world’s annual fossil fuel emissions – are set to be prevented, transforming the power basis of Americans’ cars and homes in the process.

“They have really hit full throttle. I mean, some of these things have been in train for decades,” said Thomas Burke, who was senior science adviser at the EPA during Barack Obama’s administration. “These rules are essential if the US is going to address the climate crisis and so the past month has been very encouraging. The agency seems to be on the rebound.”

If last year’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with its $370bn in clean energy subsidies and enticements for electric car buyers, was the carrot to reducing emissions, the EPA now appears to be bringing a hefty stick.

The IRA should help reduce US emissions by about 40% this decade but the cut needs to be deeper, up to half of 2005 levels, to give the world a chance of avoiding catastrophic heatwaves, wildfires, drought and other climate calamities. The new rules suddenly put America, after years of delay and political rancor, tantalizingly within reach of this.

“It’s clear we’ve reached a pivotal point in human history and it’s on all of us to act right now to protect our future,” said Michael Regan, the administrator of the EPA, in a speech last week at the University of Maryland. The venue was chosen in a nod to the young, climate-concerned voters Joe Biden hopes to court in next year’s presidential election, and who have been dismayed by Biden’s acquiescence to large-scale oil and gas drilling.

“Folks, this is our future we are talking about, and we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity for real climate action,” Regan added. “Failure is not an option, indifference is not an option, inaction is not an option.”

The various climate rules have involved grueling preparation from an agency still considered understaffed from the Trump years and now face a gamut of challenges. The right-leaning US supreme court limited the EPA’s options for cutting power plant emissions in a ruling last year and further legal challenges from Republican-led states are inevitable.

“This rule appears to utterly fly in the face of the rule of law,” said Patrick Morrisey, the attorney general of West Virginia, which triumphed in last year’s case. “We expect that we would once again prevail in court against this out-of-control agency.”

Even if the regulations survive the whim of the courts, they could still be overturned by a future president or reversed by Congress using a review mechanism that will only be negated if the rules are finalized and enacted by next summer, a tight timeline.

“They do need to go further, faster, but I think the EPA recognizes the urgency on all fronts,” said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen, an environmental campaign group. “Carbon pollution in the power sector is currently unregulated which is a really big hole in tackling the climate crisis. It’s good to see President Biden leaning in on this, even in the face of a Maga majority on the supreme court.”

It’s not just climate the EPA has acted upon in recent months. There are new standards for chemical plants, such as those that blight the so-called “Cancer Alley” of the US, from emitting cancer-causing toxins such as benzene, ethylene oxide and vinyl chloride. New rules curbing mercury, arsenic and lead from industrial facilities have been released, as have tighter limits on emissions of soot and the first ever regulations targeting the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (or PFAS) in drinking water.

“This action all seems new, it seems different,” said Burke. “Some of the things have made me think, ‘Wow, we were working on that 10 years ago. It’s a shame we lost a decade on it.’”

For those inside the agency, the breakneck pace has been enervating. “It’s definitely a race against time,” said one senior EPA official, who asked not to be named. “The clock is ticking. It is a sprint through a marathon and it is exhausting.”

The Biden administration will now have to walk the tightrope between opponents who claim the rules will cause the lights to blink off across America – Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat senator and coal baron, said he will block EPA nominees for following a “radical climate agenda” that risks prematurely shuttering coal plants – and ostensibly supportive environmental groups that have complained the power plant rule doesn’t go far enough and has carve-outs for newer and intermittent polluting plants.

A key point of contention is the rule’s indirect embrace of carbon capture technology. In order to hew to the supreme court’s verdict from last year, the EPA is requiring emissions cuts that can be reasonably made on-site by individual power plants, rather than to reshape the entire electricity grid towards solar and wind power.

These cuts could be made by scrubbing carbon from smokestacks, switching to cleaner fuels such as hydrogen or capturing the emissions and burying them underground, an expensive option that currently isn’t being used by any coal or gas plant in the US.

The EPA has now essentially called the bluff of fossil fuel interests that have previously talked up the prospects of carbon capture, but both the industry and environmentalists have now expressed skepticism, with many coal plants expected to shut rather than spend millions of dollars on new equipment and pipelines to bury emissions.

Biden also still has to grapple with accusations that his administration is fatally undermining its own progress by continuing to approve oil and gas drilling leases, at a rate faster than even under Trump, despite his promises to end drilling on public lands. The controversial decision in March to allow the vast Willow oil project in Alaska – a development that former vice-president Al Gore called “recklessly irresponsible” – will result in nearly half of the emissions the power plant rule will avoid over a 30-year period.

“We know the work to confront the climate crisis doesn’t stop at strong carbon pollution standards,” said Ben Jealous, the executive director of the Sierra Club.

“The continued use or expansion of fossil power plants is incompatible with a livable future. Simply put, we must not merely limit the use of fossil fuel electricity – we must end it entirely.”","The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a series of anti-pollution rules over the past month, including the toughest ever limits on carbon pollution from the country’s power sector. The new rules will require large coal and gas plants to reduce their emissions by 90% or face closure. The EPA has also introduced emissions standards for cars and trucks, which will eliminate an expected 9 billion tons of CO2 by the mid-point of the century. Other rules will reduce hydrofluorocarbons by 4.6 billion tons and methane by 810 million tons. In total, the rules will prevent 15 billion tons of greenhouse gases."
34,"Title: Tracking Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio - Q1 2023 Update (NYSE:BRK.A)

Paul Morigi

This article is part of a series that provides an ongoing analysis of the changes made to Berkshire Hathaway's 13F stock portfolio on a quarterly basis. It is based on Warren Buffett's regulatory 13F Form filed on 5/15/2023. Please visit our Tracking 10 Years Of Berkshire Hathaway's Investment Portfolio article series for an idea on how his holdings have progressed over the years and our previous update for the moves in Q4 2022.

During Q1 2023, Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) 13F stock portfolio value increased from ~$299B to ~$325B. The increase was primarily due to the addition of General RE's equity holdings to Berkshire's 13F report. They were reported separately before. The top five positions account for ~77% of the portfolio: Apple Inc., Bank of America, American Express, Coca Cola, and Chevron. There are 46 individual stock positions, many of which are minutely small compared to the overall size of the portfolio.

Warren Buffett's writings (pdfs) are a treasure trove of information and are a very good source for anyone starting out on individual investing.

Note 1: In Q1 2023, Berkshire Hathaway repurchased ~14.37M Class B Equivalent Shares for a total outlay of ~$4.44B. The average price paid was ~$309. Book Value as of Q1 2023 was ~$235 per share. So, the repurchase happened at ~131% of Book Value. In July 2018, Berkshire had announced a plan to make their re-purchase criteria to be more flexible - instead of the 120% of Book Value criteria, Buffett & Munger had to agree that Berkshire was trading below intrinsic value. The Class B shares currently trade at ~$324.

Note 2: Berkshire Hathaway has a ~10% stake in BYD Company (OTCPK:BYDDY) at a cost-basis of ~8 HKD per share. It currently trades in Hong Kong at ~267 HKD. Berkshire's ownership is down from ~20% as of Q3 2022.

Note 3: It was disclosed in August 2020 that Berkshire had built ~5% stakes in five Japanese trading businesses: ITOCHU, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo. The stakes were increased to ~7.4% each this quarter. The 2021 AR had the following regarding these positions - 5.6% ownership stake in ITOCHU Corporation (OTCPK:ITOCF) at a cost-basis of $23.52, 5.5% ownership stake in Mitsubishi Corporation (OTCPK:MSBHF) at a cost-basis of $25.72, and 5.7% ownership stake in Mitsui & Co.

35,"Title: Dangerous heat wave continues along West Coast

Extreme heat is the deadliest natural hazard in the U.S.

Millions of people on the West Coast are facing a continuation of intense early-season heat for multiple days, forecasts show.

Washington state began seeing record-breaking temperatures at the start of the weekend. On Sunday, Seattle could reach 90 degrees for the first time this year, which would also break the daily record high of 88 degrees. Highs in Portland and Medford, Oregon, could also break records before the weekend is through.

These temperatures are coming well in advance -- more than a month -- ahead of when they usually start creeping up.

The region, known for its typically cool and rainy climate, has been experiencing more uncharacteristic heat waves and wildfires in recent years.

The temperatures could raise the risk of heat-related illness, especially as the majority of households in the region are not equipped with central air conditioning.

High temperatures are cranking up even more further down the coast. Fresno, California, is forecast to be approaching 100 degrees on Sunday, with high temperatures of 95 degrees to 100 degrees for at least the next five days.

About 12 million people are under heat advisories along the West Coast.

More extreme heat is an indicator of human-caused climate change, according to scientists.

Extreme heat is the deadliest natural hazard in the U.S.

More than 230 locations in the U.S. have seen the annual number of minimum mortality temperature heat days -- temperatures at which the health risks also start to rise -- by 21 more days on average since 1970, according to an analysis by Climate Central.

While the South and Southeast tend to be the riskiest heat spots, increases in days above local minimum mortality temperature were observed in every region in the U.S., according to Climate Central.

ABC News' Tracy Wholf contributed to this report.","Millions of people on the West Coast are facing a continuation of intense early-season heat for multiple days, with temperatures breaking records in some areas.

36,"Title: Unexpected New Quest for Astronomers After Webb’s Mysterious Find in Rare Main Belt Comet

The James Webb Space Telescope’s latest discovery is a tale of two detections.

Solar system scientists took NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope on a treasure hunt in the asteroid belt, and what they didn’t find turned out to be as significant as what they did. If a spectrum of possible chemical compounds serves as a map of what to look for, X marked the spot of water vapor on Comet Read – a long-sought clue in the larger mystery of how Earth’s liquid water, and consequently life, first came to be. However, carbon dioxide was missing from the map, though it is present in all other comets. So in addition to continuing to pursue the history of ancient water in the solar system, scientists have an unexpected new quest on their hands, and will be hunting for answers in our cosmic backyard.

NASA’s Webb Finds Water, and a New Mystery, in Rare Main Belt Comet

NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has enabled another long-sought scientific breakthrough, this time for solar system scientists studying the origins of Earth’s abundant water. Using Webb’s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instrument, astronomers have confirmed gas – specifically water vapor – around a comet in the main asteroid belt for the first time, indicating that water ice from the primordial solar system can be preserved in that region. However, the successful detection of water comes with a new puzzle: unlike other comets, Comet 238P/Read had no detectable carbon dioxide.

“Our water-soaked world, teeming with life and unique in the universe as far as we know, is something of a mystery – we’re not sure how all this water got here,” said Stefanie Milam, Webb deputy project scientist for planetary science and a co-author on the study reporting the finding. “Understanding the history of water distribution in the solar system will help us to understand other planetary systems, and if they could be on their way to hosting an Earth-like planet,” she added.

Comet Read is a main belt comet – an object that resides in the main asteroid belt but which periodically displays a halo, or coma, and tail like a comet. Main belt comets themselves are a fairly new classification, and Comet Read was one of the original three comets used to establish the category. Before that, comets were understood to reside in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud, beyond the orbit of Neptune, where their ices could be preserved farther from the Sun. Frozen material that vaporizes as they approach the Sun is what gives comets their distinctive coma and streaming tail, differentiating them from asteroids. Scientists have long speculated that water ice could be preserved in the warmer asteroid belt, inside the orbit of Jupiter, but definitive proof was elusive – until Webb.

“In the past, we’ve seen objects in the main belt with all the characteristics of comets, but only with this precise spectral data from Webb can we say yes, it’s definitely water ice that is creating that effect,” explained astronomer Michael Kelley of the University of Maryland, lead author of the study.

“With Webb’s observations of Comet Read, we can now demonstrate that water ice from the early solar system can be preserved in the asteroid belt,” Kelley said.

The missing carbon dioxide was a bigger surprise. Typically, carbon dioxide makes up about 10 percent of the volatile material in a comet that can be easily vaporized by the Sun’s heat. The science team presents two possible explanations for the lack of carbon dioxide. One possibility is that Comet Read had carbon dioxide when it formed but has lost that because of warm temperatures.

“Being in the asteroid belt for a long time could do it – carbon dioxide vaporizes more easily than water ice, and could percolate out over billions of years,” Kelley said. Alternatively, he said, Comet Read may have formed in a particularly warm pocket of the solar system, where no carbon dioxide was available.

The next step is taking the research beyond Comet Read to see how other main belt comets compare, says astronomer Heidi Hammel of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), lead for Webb’s Guaranteed Time Observations for solar system objects and co-author of the study. “These objects in the asteroid belt are small and faint, and with Webb we can finally see what is going on with them and draw some conclusions. Do other main belt comets also lack carbon dioxide? Either way, it will be exciting to find out,” Hammel said.

Co-author Milam imagines the possibilities of bringing the research even closer to home. “Now that Webb has confirmed there is water preserved as close as the asteroid belt, it would be fascinating to follow up on this discovery with a sample collection mission, and learn what else the main belt comets can tell us.”

The study is published in the journal Nature.

37,"Title: Man Identified With Rare Mutation That Protects From Alzheimer's Disease

To many, a family history of Alzheimer's disease would feel like a heavy, ominous cloud hanging overhead. But through the clouds comes a faint shard of light: scientists have discovered a second person who should have experienced symptoms of Alzheimer's in his early 40s, but didn't.

The case joins another who was identified several years ago with a genetic mutation thought to have played a role in delaying signs of her own underlying Alzheimer's pathology.

Instead of receiving a life-altering diagnosis in his prime, the recently described Colombian man carried on working until he retired in his early 60s, and only then, years later at 67, did the first signs of cognitive decline materialize.

Brain scans revealed his brain had atrophied and was laden with the classic, molecular hallmarks of the disease: high numbers of sticky protein clumps known as amyloid plaques, along with a few knotted tangles of another protein called tau. These kinds of aggregates are usually seen in people with severe dementia. Yet the man had somehow resisted Alzheimer's disease far longer than anyone expected.

It turns out, that in addition to the genetic variant that foretold his diagnosis, the man also carried a rare variant in another gene encoding a protein called reelin that seemingly protected him from developing Alzheimer's disease for more than two decades.

In one small, specific part of his brain where neurons are involved in memory and navigation, the man had very low levels of tangled tau. It was as if the genetic lottery had gifted him a protective protein that held Alzheimer's disease at bay in this one critical brain region that usually succumbs to the disease quite early.

While little is currently known about reelin's role in Alzheimer's disease, animal experiments by a team of researchers headed up by Colombian neurologist Francisco Lopera showed that the mutated form of reelin also stopped tau proteins knotting together around neurons in the brains of mice. The team's findings are published Nature Medicine.

Neuroscientist Catherine Kaczorowski, who was not involved in the research, told Nature that reading the paper ""made the hair on my arms stand up.""

""It's just such an important new avenue to pursue new therapies for Alzheimer's disease,"" said Kaczorowski, a researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

The hope is that by studying how reelin interacts with Alzheimer's proteins and protects neurons in their clutches, researchers could potentially find a way to boost resilience across all forms of Alzheimer's disease, and not just in those who inherit its protective variant.

Though it is from families like the one Lopera has been following in Colombia for nearly 40 years that we are learning so much about Alzheimer's disease. In the man's extended family, which spans decades, generations, and some 6,000 people, many harbor a common mutation that causes Alzheimer's to strike early, in middle age.

It is typically referred to as the Paisa mutation after those in Colombia's Antioquia region, who have offered up their blood, bodies, and brains to aid research.

As journalist Jennie Erin Smith wrote for Undark in 2019, Alzheimer's research ""leans heavily on families with early-onset, genetic forms of the disease to understand its progress and test therapies that might interrupt it.""

In the latest study, Lopera, at the University of Antioquia in Medellín, Colombia, and colleagues analyzed clinical and genetic data from about 1,200 individuals of that Colombian kindred. They identified the new and extremely rare variant in the man who remained cognitively intact, as well as his sister, who was less protected than her brother and died years earlier.

In 2019, Lopera and his colleagues reported another case of a woman carrying the Paisa mutation who showed no signs of cognitive decline until her 70s – some 30-odd years later than expected for carriers of the mutation. Studies showed she too had unusually low levels of tau throughout her brain, but her resilience to Alzheimer's was attributed to a different mutation in another gene: APOE.

Researchers think there may be some overlap or interplay between the variant reelin and APOE proteins that could explain their protective effect, yet it's possible that other genetic variants contribute too. For now, Lopera and colleagues say their findings only help shape new hypotheses about Alzheimer's disease.

In time, if treatments to tap into the reelin signaling pathway could be developed, they ""may have a profound therapeutic impact on the resistance to tau pathology and neurodegeneration, and resilience against cognitive decline and dementia in Alzheimer's disease,"" the researchers conclude.

The research has been published in Nature Medicine.","Scientists have identified a Colombian man who carried a rare genetic variant that protected him from developing Alzheimer's disease for over two decades. The man had a genetic mutation that delayed the onset of Alzheimer's pathology, as well as a rare variant in another gene encoding a protein called reelin, which protected him from developing the disease. Brain scans revealed that the man had very low levels of tangled tau in a specific part of his brain involved in memory and navigation. Animal experiments showed that the mutated form of reelin stopped tau proteins knotting together around neurons in the brains of mice. The findings offer a new avenue for developing therapies for Alzheimer's disease."
38,"Title: A Florida man living underwater won't resurface even after breaking the record

A university professor broke a record for the longest time living underwater without depressurization this weekend at a Florida Keys lodge for scuba divers

KEY LARGO, Fla. -- A university professor broke a record for the longest time living underwater without depressurization this weekend at a Florida Keys lodge for scuba divers.

Joseph Dituri’s 74th day residing in Jules’ Undersea Lodge, situated at the bottom of a 30-foot-deep lagoon in Key Largo, wasn’t much different than his previous days there since he submerged March 1.

Dituri, who also goes by the moniker “Dr. Deep Sea,” ate a protein-heavy meal of eggs and salmon prepared using a microwave, exercised with resistance bands, did his daily pushups and took an hour-long nap. Unlike a submarine, the lodge does not use technology to adjust for the increased underwater pressure.

The previous record of 73 days, two hours and 34 minutes was set by two Tennessee professors -- Bruce Cantrell and Jessica Fain -- at the same location in 2014.

But Dituri isn't just settling for the record and resurfacing: He plans to stay at the lodge until June 9, when he reaches 100 days and completes an underwater mission dubbed Project Neptune 100.

The mission combines medical and ocean research along with educational outreach and was organized by the Marine Resources Development Foundation, owner of the habitat.

“The record is a small bump and I really appreciate it,” said Dituri, a University of South Florida educator who holds a doctorate in biomedical engineering and is a retired U.S. Naval officer. “I’m honored to have it, but we still have more science to do.”

His research includes daily experiments in physiology to monitor how the human body responds to long-term exposure to extreme pressure.

“The idea here is to populate the world’s oceans, to take care of them by living in them and really treating them well,” Dituri said.

The outreach portion of Dituri’s mission includes conducting online classes and broadcast interviews from his digital studio beneath the sea. During the past 74 days, he has reached over 2,500 students through online classes in marine science and more with his regular biomedical engineering courses at the University of South Florida.

While he says he loves living under the ocean, there is one thing he really misses.

“The thing that I miss the most about being on the surface is literally the sun,” Dituri said. “The sun has been a major factor in my life – I usually go to the gym at five and then I come back out and watch the sunrise.”","A university professor named Joseph Dituri broke the record for the longest time living underwater without depressurization at Jules' Undersea Lodge in Key Largo, Florida.

On May 14, 1973, the final Saturn V rocket lifted off to deploy Skylab, America’s first space station. Despite a troubled start to its life, Skylab pioneered long-duration spaceflight, and fifty years later lessons learned in this program are still contributing to the success of the International Space Station.

With Apollo 11’s successful landing on the Moon in July 1969, NASA had met President Kennedy’s challenge of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth by the end of the 1960s. While six more crewed lunar missions would follow over the next three and a half years, the objective had been achieved and funding was cut. With missions past Apollo 17 canceled, NASA’s attention returned to low Earth orbit, and the development of a space station using Apollo hardware. This would allow the agency to continue scientific research and study the effects of spaceflight on crews over the course of long-duration missions.

The launch of Skylab came two years after the Soviet Union had deployed the world’s first space station, Salyut 1. This station only hosted a single crew, which arrived aboard the ill-fated Soyuz 11 mission in June 1971, the earlier Soyuz 10 mission having failed to dock. After three weeks aboard Salyut 1 the Soyuz 11 crew returned to Earth, but were killed when their capsule depressurized during re-entry.

Although the Soviet Union would launch three more space stations in 1972 and early 1973, the first of these failed to reach orbit and the next two malfunctioned shortly after deployment, with no Soyuz missions being launched to any of them. Skylab was, therefore, the second space station to be crewed in orbit, but as of 2023 it remains the only crewed station to have been operated exclusively by the United States.

Design and Launch

With a mass of 76,500 kilograms (168,800 lb) and a length of 25 meters (82 feet), Skylab was considerably larger than Salyut and still remains the largest monolithic space station (i.e. deployed as a single unit) ever launched and one of the largest spacecraft ever to operate in Earth orbit. Only modular space stations assembled in orbit (specifically Mir and the International Space Station), the Space Shuttle orbiters, and Buran have surpassed it in mass. The Soviet Polyus experimental military platform also had a greater mass than Skylab, however it failed to reach orbit.

Skylab’s large size was a result of its use of surplus hardware from the Apollo program. Its Orbital Workshop (OWS), the main section of Skylab, was converted from an S-IVB stage that had been intended for a Saturn IB rocket. A Saturn V rocket left over from the cancellation of the last three planned lunar Apollo missions would be used to place it into orbit.

Alongside the lunar program, NASA had planned the Apollo Applications Programme (AAP) to take advantage of hardware and technologies developed during Apollo for a range of other missions. The Orbital Workshop had originated from this project, with two concepts being considered: the “Dry Workshop” – which would see the stage converted before launch – and the “Wet Workshop” which would convert a live S-IVB stage from a Saturn IB launch on-orbit.

As a dedicated station, the Dry Workshop – which would later evolve into Skylab – would provide more space for astronauts, be able to carry more equipment, and not require as much of their time to convert – allowing for more time on-orbit to conduct experiments. Since its main propulsion system and propellant tanks were removed, the station would not be able to contribute to its own ascent to orbit, so a modified Saturn V would be needed to deploy it.

McDonnell Douglas, the manufacturer of the S-IVB, would be responsible for converting the stage into Skylab’s Orbital Workshop, under a contract signed in August 1969.

As well as the Orbital Workshop, Skylab incorporated a Multiple Docking Adapter (MDA) with two ports for Apollo spacecraft to dock, an airlock, and the Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) observatory which carried instruments to study the Sun. Although the station had two docking ports, the second was intended as a backup, rather than a means of having two spacecraft docked simultaneously – although this could have been supported if necessary. Power was to be generated by two main solar panels attached to the OWS, with four additional panels mounted at right angles on the ATM.

Skylab’s launch would mark the thirteenth and final flight of the legendary Saturn V rocket, which had powered previous Apollo missions on their journeys to the Moon. For the Skylab mission, the rocket flew in a two-stage configuration, with the Orbital Workshop taking the place of the S-IVB third stage. The rocket’s instrument unit (IU) was incorporated at the forward end of the OWS, with a four-sector payload fairing encapsulating the airlock, MDA and ATM.

For launch, the ATM stowed forward of the main docking port. Once in orbit, it was relocated to its operational position perpendicular to the rest of the station. The Skylab launch was the only time a Saturn V would fly with a payload fairing. Like earlier Saturn V missions, the rocket was assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center, with build-up commencing on Aug. 2, 1972. The rocket was stacked atop Mobile Launcher 2, which was then moved to Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) by Crawler Transporter.

Saturn V SA-513, the rocket tasked with deploying Skylab, would have an eventful climb toward orbit. Liftoff occurred at 1:30:00 p.m. EDT (17:30:00 UTC) on May 14, 1973, with the five F-1 engines of the S-IC first stage powering Saturn aloft. After clearing the tower the rocket began a pitch-and-roll maneuver to establish itself on its planned trajectory, building up speed as it climbed and reaching Mach 1, the speed of sound, just over a minute after liftoff.

About 63 seconds into the flight, the Orbital Workshop’s micrometeoroid shield – which was also designed to act as a critical part of the station’s thermal control system – suffered a structural failure and detached. Debris from this damaged tie-down fittings holding the No.2 solar array in its launch position, jammed the No.1 solar array and also damaged the separation systems on the interstage between the first and second stages of the rocket. These events occurred about ten seconds before the rocket passed through Max-Q, or the area of maximum dynamic pressure.

The launch continued, with the S-IC burning all five engines until T+140 seconds, when its center F-1 was shut down as planned to reduce acceleration. The remaining engines shut down in pairs, about 18 seconds later, before the first and second stages separated. Retro-rockets pushed the S-IC away from the S-II second stage, whose five J-2 engines ignited to take over the job of boosting Skylab towards orbit.

A little under 20 seconds after S-II ignition, the interstage should have been jettisoned from the aft end of the stage. This did not occur as scheduled, with a post-flight analysis determining that one of the shaped charges responsible for separating the interstage had most likely been damaged by debris from the micrometeoroid shield. Instead, the interstage remained attached all the way to orbit, with higher temperatures being recorded around the base of the stage as a result. The rocket had sufficient reserve propellant to make up for any underperformance as a result of its additional mass.

Five minutes and 14 seconds into the flight, the S-II’s center engine was commanded to shut down with the four outboard engines continuing to fire until the nine-minute, 48-second mark. About two seconds after shutdown, Skylab was released from the second stage, which then fired retro motors to maneuver itself away and reduce the risk of recontact between itself and the space station. The No.2 solar array, whose tie-downs had been severed by the initial debris incident earlier in the launch, was caught in the exhaust of the retro rockets and ripped away from the station.

Despite this incident, Skylab’s deployment sequence continued as scheduled, with the payload fairing separating at 15 minutes, 20 seconds mission elapsed time. The station then re-oriented itself to the planned sun-angle for solar array deployment, and shortly afterward began to deploy the ATM to its post-launch position.

With this in place, the ATM’s solar panels were deployed successfully, however the one remaining solar panel on the OWS failed to open. This left the station with insufficient power to support long-duration missions beyond the lifespan of the fuel cells on visiting Apollo spacecraft, while the loss of thermal protection from the lost micrometeoroid shield meant that temperatures aboard the station were uninhabitable.

The launch of the first crew to Skylab was delayed while NASA evaluated data from the launch to devise a rescue plan. On May 16, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) launched a KH-8 Gambit spy satellite, OPS-2093, from Vandenberg Air Force Base, tasked with capturing images of the crippled Skylab to help assess the damage. One of the satellite’s two film-return capsules was used to send these back to Earth on May 21, by which point plans for a repair mission were in an advanced stage of planning, with launch four days away.

Crewed Missions

Three long-duration crews, each consisting of three astronauts, visited Skylab aboard Apollo Command and Service Modules (CSMs). All three missions were launched in 1973, with each setting a new record for the longest-duration human spaceflight up to that time. The crewed missions launched atop Saturn IB rockets, flying from the modified Mobile Launcher 1 (later MLP-3) at LC-39B using a “milkstool” adaptor which enabled the smaller Saturn IB to make use of the Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) that had been built for the Saturn V.

Skylab’s first crew was commanded by Gemini and Apollo 12 veteran Pete Conrad, who was joined by rookies Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz. Designated Skylab 2, their mission lifted off on May 25, 1973, having been delayed from May 15 due to the damage Skylab had sustained during launch. While the astronauts had trained for a mission of scientific research, they found themselves responsible first for putting NASA’s rescue plan into effect to save the space station that was to become their home for the next few weeks.

After rendezvous with Skylab, the crew performed a flyaround of the outpost to inspect the damage. After the CSM was maneuvered close to the stuck solar array, Weitz performed a stand-up spacewalk from the Command Module hatch in an attempt to free the panel using tools mounted on a three-meter (10-foot) long pole, but was unsuccessful as a strip of metal blocking its deployment was wrapped around a beam and could not be freed with the available tools.

The crew proceeded to dock with the station, however their spacecraft’s docking system failed to engage. After some troubleshooting, including depressurizing the Command Module again and removing the back plate of the docking probe, a successful docking was achieved.

When the crew boarded Skylab the following day, one of their first tasks was to deploy a replacement sun shield which had been rapidly improvised on the ground. This consisted of a “parasol” device in a canister which could be deployed from a small science airlock on the Orbital Workshop. Once this was completed, temperatures aboard the station began to stabilize and the crew were able to begin their planned science mission.

Owing in part to concerns around the reliability of Skylab’s batteries, which could have jeopardized future missions to the station, another attempt to free the jammed solar panel was made on June 7. Conrad and Kerwin performed a three-hour, 25-minute EVA to cut away the debris and attach a tether that was then used to pull the solar array free. With this accomplished successfully, concerns about Skylab’s ability to generate electrical power became less acute.

A further EVA was conducted on June 19 by Conrad and Weitz, the first of several to change out film cassettes in the Apollo Telescope Mount. The crew returned to Earth on June 22, completing their 28-day mission.

The second crewed mission – Skylab 3 – was commanded by another former member of the Apollo 12 crew in Alan Bean. Bean was joined by rookies Owen Garriott and Jack Lousma for the mission, which lifted off on July 28, 1973, and splashed down 59 and a half days later on Sept. 25. The final mission was launched on Nov. 16, with an all-rookie crew: Gerald P. Carr commanding with Edward G. Gibson and William R. Pogue.

Skylab 4’s stay aboard the station would be the longest, at over 83 days. The crew returned to Earth on Feb. 8, 1974, after which no more astronauts would set foot aboard the Skylab station.

Although its three expeditions are short by modern standards – the astronauts of Dragon Freedom‘s Crew-4 mission last year spent roughly the same time aboard the International Space Station as Skylab was crewed across all three missions – these were the longest human spaceflights in history for their time. As such, medical research was a significant focus for studies to ensure crews could remain fit and healthy during extended stays in space.

A bicycle ergometer was provided for crew exercise, with the metabolic responses of the astronauts being monitored to track their physiological condition. Other experiments included a rotating chair that was used to test the astronauts’ sensitivity to motion sickness and pre-and-post-flight x-rays to look for mineral loss – combined with the examination of urine samples that showed the astronauts were excreting greater amounts of calcium and hydroxyproline than expected.

The only research that took up more time than life science research was solar physics. The Apollo Telescope Mount contained instruments to study the Sun in detail, with the crew able to fine-tune the observations. A key objective achieved by the Skylab 2 mission was to record a solar flare in progress. Paul Weitz accomplished this on June 15, 1973, tracking a flare for two minutes as it rose and fell.

Throughout the lifetime of the station, crews made a number of spacewalks to collect film cassettes from the telescope mount and to install replacements. A total of 127,000 frames of film were captured by the Skylab’s telescopes.

Other research carried out aboard the station included Earth observation, using photography and multispectral imaging, and microwave measurement of soil moisture. During Skylab 4, the crew was tasked with observing designated areas and briefed on what to look for and photograph, in an attempt to assess the utility of using crew to target observations.

Crew time was also given over to technology development research – including tests of an astronaut maneuvering device aboard the station – materials science and manufacturing, astrophysics, and student experiments.

Legacy

While crewed Skylab operations ended with the departure of the Skylab 4 crew, NASA had hoped to reactivate the station once the Space Shuttle became operational. Ultimately this was prevented by a combination of increased atmospheric drag causing Skylab to decay from orbit more quickly than expected, and delays to the Shuttle program.

Under early plans, the third Space Shuttle mission would have been flown by astronauts Jack Lousma and Fred Haise, who would have deployed a module called the Teleoperator Retrieval System (TRS). TRS would have then been docked with Skylab via remote control from the Shuttle. Once docked, its thrusters would have been used to raise the space station into a higher orbit — or to deorbit it to a controlled re-entry if deemed necessary. TRS was later moved to the second Shuttle mission as the program began to fall behind schedule, but would be abandoned when it became clear that Skylab was going to re-enter before the Shuttle would be ready to fly.

Skylab re-entered the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean on July 11, 1979, with some debris reaching the coast of Australia.

When the Space Shuttle finally flew in 1981, NASA gained a spacecraft capable of carrying out significant amounts of on-orbit research independently – particularly when equipped with a Spacelab or later Spacehab, module in its payload bay. As such, the agency pivoted away from space stations and instead focussed on the Shuttle. A new station called Freedom was proposed in the mid-1980s, using the Space Shuttle to assemble multiple modules in orbit. While this was never built as designed, its design would later form the basis for the International Space Station which began on-orbit construction in 1998.

The end of the Space Shuttle program has seen NASA’s primary focus shift back towards missions of exploration, with the Artemis program aiming to return humans to the Moon, while crewed missions in low Earth orbit are being outsourced to commercial operators. The advent of commercial human spaceflight has seen a renewed interest in space station development, with several companies investigating the development of new orbital outposts. These include Orbital Reef – a partnership between Blue Origin and Sierra Space – and Starlab, which is being built by a consortium including Lockheed Martin, NanoRacks, and Voyager Space.

Axiom Space has already flown one commercial mission to the International Space Station, with another planned for later this month. These serve as precursors to the company deploying its own space station modules – initially as an annex of the ISS, but these could lead to a free-flying station in the future.

Another startup, Vast, has announced plans in the last week to launch a small space station called Haven-1 in 2025 aboard SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. This is planned to host a four-person crew for thirty days, launching aboard a Crew Dragon spacecraft.

The impact of SpaceX’s own Starship on the future of space stations is yet to be seen. With the ability to carry greater numbers of humans or larger amounts of cargo into orbit, it could vastly reduce the cost of transporting crew and equipment to outposts in low Earth orbit. Alternatively, it might be adapted as a research platform in its own right, much as the Shuttle was with the addition of research modules, taking the place of space stations.

No matter what the future holds, Skylab was one of the first steps on a journey towards understanding human reactions to long-duration spaceflight which has enabled space stations to flourish over the subsequent decades. Building on its legacy, and that of the Soviet Salyut and Mir stations, the ISS continues to deliver invaluable science. The experience with long-duration missions that has been honed aboard these outposts will also be key to future spaceflight beyond Earth’s orbit.

40,"Title: Erdogan Arrested and Expelled International Officials Observing Turkish Election

The government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan swept up and jailed a team of international observers on hand to monitor election day activity in Turkey on Sunday, members of the team told The Intercept in a statement.

The delegation had not been granted official observer accreditation by the Erdogan government, but were formally invited by the HDP, the leading Kurdish party and a key member of the opposition coalition.

The election held on Sunday was the closest contest Erdogan has faced in the two decades he has been in power. Immediately, the opposition coalition, led by Kemal Kilicdaroglu, charged election irregularities, zeroing in on what Kilicdaroglu said was an extremely large number of objections to ballot boxes in Istanbul and Ankara — urban areas where the opposition dominated. “You are blocking the will of Turkey,” Kilicdaroglu said.

Erdogan fell short of the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff, officially winning more than 49.5 percent of the vote with fewer than 100,000 overseas ballots remaining to be tallied. A runoff will be held on May 28. Sinan Ogan, whose 5 percent of the vote forced the runoff by keeping both candidates under 50 percent, also made allegations of vote-counting manipulation by the government.

The Spanish observers included members of the left-leaning Podemos party; EH Bildu, a Basque nationalist coalition; and a senator from Esquerra Republicana, a Catalonian leftist party. The observers were in the Kurdish-majority city of Siirt when they were arrested and taken to a police station on Sunday, the day of the election. Officers then went to the hotel where the observers were staying and arrested the remaining members of the delegation, who joined their comrades in detention at the police station. They were held until Monday morning and released on the condition they leave the country, escorted to the airport and flown back to Spain on Monday and Tuesday.

Ismael Cortés, a national congressional deputy with Podemos, and Miriam Ojeda, a representative of the International Secretariat of Podemos, were among those detained. Spain and Turkey are both members of NATO.

“The situation of the retention and expulsion as a delegation that we have experienced is just one example of the greater context of repression and persecution of the opposition that has been experienced for years in Turkey and that has the Kurdish people as a special objective,” said Cortés. “We are concerned about the situation of the members and supporters of the YSP and HDP party and the respect for their fundamental, civil, and political rights.”

The observers also said in a statement to The Intercept that several members of the Kurdish YSP party were also arrested. Their fate is not known, and the Erdogan government did not respond to requests for comment. “This new and intolerable example of repression demonstrates the authoritarian drift of the regime of Erdogan, which undermines the democratic principles and fundamental rights of the Turkish citizenry and, especially, of the peoples present in this territory, such as the Kurdish,” the observers said in the statement.

Polls taken ahead of the election had the opposition ahead of Erdogan, sometimes by as much as 5 or 6 percentage points, leaving observers stunned at Erdogan beating the opposition by at least 4 points in the first round. Selim Koru, an analyst at the Ankara-based Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey and a critic of Erdogan, said that he doesn’t believe most of the vote-counting claims being made by the opposition will hold up. “The big thing is that most people in the opposition space came to trust the polls. Most of the evidence really favored the opposition,” he said. “But polling these days has a problem detecting right-wing bias. Something similar happened in the U.S. in 2016. We thought the pollsters took that into account, but I guess they didn’t.”

Ahead of the election, Erdogan’s government pressured Twitter to censor opposition voices and critical journalists — a request to which Twitter’s outgoing CEO Elon Musk instantly capitulated. “In response to legal process and to ensure Twitter remains available to the people of Turkey, we have taken action to restrict access to some content in Turkey today,” Twitter posted.

Musk acknowledged that the government had threatened to take the site down, as Erdogan did in 2014 when Twitter refused to comply with a similar demand. The previous Twitter leadership, however, took Turkey’s government to court and prevailed in its Supreme Court.

Update: May 16, 2023, 7:15 a.m.

This piece has been updated with a quote from Ismael Cortés.","International observers invited by the leading Kurdish party to monitor the Turkish election were arrested and expelled by the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

What causes fatigue after Covid infection?

The nervous system of people with post-Covid fatigue was found to be underactive in key areas, increasing the risk of fatigue -- one of the most common symptoms of long Covid, according to researchers.

A team from the Newcastle University in the UK carried out a battery of behavioural and neurophysiological tests on people suffering from post-Covid fatigue and compared them to people without fatigue.

The researchers discovered people with post-Covid fatigue showed underactivity in three specific areas of the nervous system.

They found a slower reaction in specific areas of the brain because of underactivity in specific cortical circuits; an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system -- the network of nerves that regulates unconscious body processes such as blood pressure and the rate of breathing was found to be impaired. This can have wide-ranging effects on several different body processes.

They also found muscle abnormalities -- muscle fibres became more easily fatigued after exercise than in people without post-Covid fatigue.

""These abnormalities in the results on objective tests show that fatigue in long Covid is a measurable disease and these tests may, in time, help us understand how changes in the nervous system contribute to fatigue,"" said Dr Demetris Soteropoulos, Senior Lecturer in Motor Systems Neuroscience at the University.

The research has been published in Brain Communications.

A group of 37 volunteers with post-Covid fatigue underwent a range of well-established non-invasive behavioural and neurophysiological tests. Their results were compared to those of 52 control subjects, matched for age and sex, who underwent the same tests. The tests which provided 33 sets of data included a startle reaction time test, electrocardiogram and transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Following on from these findings, the team now will begin testing on whether the autonomic nervous system can be modulated to improve symptoms in post-Covid fatigue.

""We're examining a non-invasive method which involves clipping an earpiece to the tragus on the ear and delivering small electrical currents to the vagus nerve using a TENS machine -- familiar to many through its use for pain relief during childbirth,"" said Natalie Maffitt, Research Assistant at the varsity.

The study will examine the effects of the treatment by measuring markers of inflammation in the blood that are associated with fatigue in other conditions and importantly, whether it improves symptoms of fatigue.","Researchers from Newcastle University have found that post-Covid fatigue is caused by underactivity in key areas of the nervous system, leading to slower reaction times in the brain, an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system, and muscle abnormalities.

Musk will continue serving Twitter as CTO and executive chairman.

Yaccarino left her job as head of advertising at NBCUniversal on Friday morning to take on the job of helping Musk transition Twitter into X, his envisioned “everything app"" that will incorporate social media and payments (possibly including crypto) along the lines of China’s WeChat.

Musk is also pro-crypto. His electric car company Tesla is currently one of the largest institutional HODLers of Bitcoin, even after it sold three quarters of its original holdings. He is a fan of Dogecoin, and his frequent tweets about it often pump the price. He even replaced Twitter’s blue bird logo with the Doge meme for a few days, so a potential crypto integration is conceivable, especially as a payments option.

Elsewhere on Crypto Twitter this week, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong kicked things off by praising the UAE for its “clear rule book” when it comes to crypto regulations.

Coinbase is a publicly traded U.S. company, but the hostile domestic regulatory environment is driving it offshore. The company recently obtained a license to operate in Bermuda and used it to open an international exchange offering Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures. It is also currently talking with the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FRSA), a regulator of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM)—a crypto-friendly free economic zone in the UAE—about opening a regulated exchange there.

Circle’s EU strategy and policy director Patrick Hansen on Tuesday shared a chart showing just how MiCA is stealing the wind from U.S. sails. European Union lawmakers last month approved MiCA, or the Markets in Crypto Assets bill, which now means the bloc has a unified regulatory approach throughout its 27 member states and licenses granted to crypto companies in one country can be “passported” to another member state. The rules on stablecoins come into force in July 2024, while other requirements will not be enforced until January 2025.

WestJet has issued a lockout notice in response to the union's strike notification, saying that a work stoppage could potentially occur on May 19, the date given by the union.

North American pilots are pressing for higher salaries and better scheduling after aviators made big gains in a recent deal with Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) that delivers a 34% pay increase over four years. In Canada, pilots want better scheduling and to close the gap between their pay and higher amounts earned by their U.S. counterparts.

Calgary-based WestJet said the carrier wants an agreement that is competitive within Canada's airline industry.

44,"Title: Supreme Court to review South Carolina congressional map for discrimination against Black voters

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether South Carolina's congressional districts need to be redrawn because they discriminate against Black voters.

The justices said Monday they would review a lower-court ruling that found a coastal district running from Charleston to Hilton Head was intentionally redrawn to reduce the number of Democratic-leaning Black voters and to make it more likely Republican candidates would win.

The case probably will be argued in the fall, and decided in the run up to the 2024 elections, when all the seats in the closely divided House of Representatives, now under Republican control, will be on the ballot.

The three-judge court that ruled in favor of civil rights groups that challenged the congressional map said in its opinion in January that the districts violated the federal Voting Rights Act by unfairly diluting the power of Black voters.

The Supreme Court has cut back on the reach of the landmark voting rights law, and is now weighing an Alabama case that could make it still harder to win lawsuits claiming racial discrimination in redistricting.

Republican Rep. Nancy Mace currently represents the 1st District. She narrowly beat Joe Cunningham in 2020 after Cunningham became the first Democrat to flip a U.S. House seat in South Carolina in 30 years.

In the round of redistricting that took place following the 2020 census, Republicans who control the state government redrew the district. Mace won by 14 percentage points in November.

Republicans defending the map have said partisan considerations, the desire to maintain the 6-1 Republican edge in the state's congressional districts, drove their decision, not race.

Civil rights groups quickly sued, labeling the plan the Legislature adopted “perhaps the worst option of the available maps” for Black voters.","The Supreme Court will review whether South Carolina's congressional districts discriminate against Black voters.

45,"Title: Happy birthday, Bobi! World's oldest dog celebrates another year

The stout, sociable dog has never been chained or leashed.

Example video title will go here for this video

CONQUEIROS, Portugal — The world's oldest dog recently celebrated his 31st birthday, according to Guinness World Records.

Bobi, a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo, a breed of Portuguese dog, celebrated during a party Saturday at his home in the Portuguese village of Conqueiros, where has lived his entire life.

More than 100 people attended the “very traditional” Portuguese party, owner Leonel Costa said.

Local meats and fish were served to up to 100 guests, with extra for Bobi, who only eats human food. A dance troupe also performed with Bobi participating in one of their routines.

Costa has owned several old-age dogs in the past, including Bobi’s mother, Gira, who lived to age 18. However, Costa said he never imagined any of his dogs would reach their 30s.

“We see situations like this as a normal result of the life that they have, but Bobi is one of a kind,” Costa said.

One of the biggest contributing factors to Bobi’s longevity is the “calm, peaceful environment” in which he lives, according to Costa.

Throughout his life, Bobi has freely roamed the forests surrounding the Costa house. He has never been chained or leashed.

The “very sociable” dog was never lonely because he grew up surrounded by many other animals, Costa said.

Now in his senior years, Bobi finds it difficult to walk, so he prefers to hang out at home in the yard. His eyesight has gotten worse, meaning he often bumps into things when he walks. Just like old-age humans, Bobi sleeps a lot. He immediately lies down in bed after eating, although on cold days he chooses to nap by the fire, his owner said.

Bobi’s birth date has been confirmed by the Veterinary Medical Service of the Municipality of Leiria, which registered Bobi in 1992.

His age also has been verified by a pet database authorized by the Portuguese government.

Costa, now 38, was just 8 years old when Bobi was born. For him, Bobi is a living reminder of the past, he said.","Bobi, a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo, recently celebrated his 31st birthday, making him the world's oldest dog according to Guinness World Records.

46,"Title: Here's where Biden and McCarthy stand on debt ceiling talks heading into today's meeting

President Joe Biden hosts debt limit talks with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in the Oval Office at the White House on May 9, 2023.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is set to meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday afternoon alongside other top congressional leaders to discuss the debt ceiling, a day before Biden is slated to head to Japan for the Group of Seven summit.

Behind the scenes, staff from both sides have been working daily since the leaders met last week to try to come to a deal before June, when the federal government could run out of money. The leaders left the previous meeting with little progress to show.

""I really think there's a desire on their part, as well as ours, to reach an agreement, and I think we'll be able to do it,"" Biden told reporters Sunday in Delaware. As to his state of mind, he said, ""I remain optimistic because I'm a congenital optimist.""

McCarthy sang a different tune, telling NBC News on Monday outside the Capitol, ""I still think we're far apart.""

""It doesn't seem to me yet that they want a deal,"" McCarthy said. ""It seems like they want to look like they're in a meeting. They're not talking anything serious.""

Biden and McCarthy were slated to meet again Friday with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who attended the last meeting, but that was postponed as negotiations continued behind the scenes. Vice President Kamala Harris will also attend this time.

A source familiar with the meetings told NBC News that the delay is a positive development and a sign that talks were ""progressing.""

The White House has maintained that Biden intends to go to the G-7 summit in Japan later this week, but the president himself has said that could change depending on the debt ceiling talks. After the G-7 trip, Biden was slated to travel to Papua New Guinea before going to Australia for a meeting of the leaders of the ""Quad"" nations, the U.S., Australia, Japan and India.

McCarthy told reporters it was critical that they reach a deal before this weekend so the bill would have enough time to pass through both chambers of Congress and make it back to the president's desk for signing.

The discussions have high stakes: Defaulting on sovereign debt would wreak havoc on the economy and roil global markets. A default on Treasury bonds could throw the U.S. economy into a tailspin. The last time congressional Republicans threatened a default in 2011, Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S. credit rating for the first time ever to AA+ from AAA.

Lifting the debt ceiling is necessary for the government to cover spending commitments already approved by Congress and the president and prevent default. Doing so does not authorize new spending. But House Republicans have said they will not lift the limit if Biden and lawmakers do not agree to future spending cuts.

The Treasury Department has taken extraordinary steps to keep paying the government's bills, and expects to be able to avoid a first-ever default at least until early June. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned last week failure to hike the debt ceiling would cause an ""economic catastrophe.""

If the U.S. were to default, gross domestic product would drop 4% and more than 7 million workers would lose their jobs, Moody's Analytics recently projected. Even a brief default would lead to the loss of 2 million jobs, according to the data.","President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are set to meet with other congressional leaders to discuss the debt ceiling, with negotiations ongoing behind the scenes.

48,"Title: The housing market correction would regain new life if the U.S. defaults, says Moody’s chief economist

Speaking in front of Congress earlier this month, Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told senators that by his calculation the U.S. Treasury could run out of cash as soon as early June. If Congress doesn’t act, and the U.S. were to default, it’d have broad economic consequences.

One of the most vulnerable areas of the economy being the U.S. housing market.

See, in the unlikely scenario that the U.S. Treasury were to default—or even appear like it might default—financial markets, Zandi tells Fortune, would put upward pressure on long-term rates like mortgage rates. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, which sits at 6.55% as of Friday, he says, could go back above 7% if a default looked likely.

Another big jump in mortgage rates would be a gut punch for many homebuyers and sellers, who were at the brunt of last year’s mortgage rate shock. Already, national housing affordability (or better put the lack of affordability) has reached levels not seen since the housing bubble era. If mortgage rates were to spike again, housing affordability could deteriorate to a level that exceeds the bubble.

If mortgage rates were to go higher, Zandi says, it’d accelerate the ongoing housing market correction—which lost some momentum this spring. (The latest forecast produced by Moody’s Analytics, which doesn’t factor in a default, expects U.S. home prices—which are already down 3% from the 2022 peak—to fall 8.6% peak-to-trough this cycle).

Zillow is also concerned.

On Thursday, Zillow published an article with the headline: ""A debt ceiling default would send the U.S. housing market back into a deep freeze.""

While Zillow economist Jeff Tucker acknowledges that a U.S. default would be ""unlikely,"" he agrees that it'd see mortgage rates go higher and put the housing market back into a sharp slowdown.

""If the U.S. were to enter default in the coming months, one near-certain consequence would be rising debt yields and interest rates... Introducing default risk, or at least the risk of delayed coupon payments, would be like an earthquake rattling that bedrock assumption, sending ripples through the financial system and causing investors to question the safety not just of T-bills but other assets as well. Critically for the housing market, the interest rates on mortgages would almost certainly rise in concert,"" Tucker writes.

If the U.S. were to default, Zillow predicts the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate would spike to a peak of 8.4% by September, while home sales volumes would fall 23%. When it comes to home prices, Zillow thinks a default would see national home values go down another 1%.

""Any major disruption to the economy and debt markets will have major repercussions for the housing market, chilling sales and raising borrowing costs, just when the market was beginning to stabilize and recover from the major cooldown of late 2022,"" Tucker writes.
