This decorator takes in a maximum size parameter which specifies the maximum number of method calls that can be stored in the cache. When a method call is made, it will check if it already exists in the cache and if so, it will return the cached result. If not, it will execute the method and store it in the cache. For example, the below code will only execute the add() method if it hasn't been called before using the same arguments:\n\n<pre><code>@lru_cache(maxsize=32)\ndef add(x,y):\n    return x + y\n\n# This will be executed\nresult = add(2,3)\n\n# This will be pulled from the cache\nresult2 = add(2,3)\n</code></pre>\n\nYou can read more about lru_cache and other caching techniques in Python here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache", "score": 0.5358110666275024, "input": null, "reference_output": null}], "updated_at": "2023-08-07T14:10:52.218603", "created_at": "2023-08-07T14:10:52.218603", "page": null, "page_size": null, "total_pages": null, "total_count": null}
