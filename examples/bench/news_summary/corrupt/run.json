It marks the end of an era of long-distance spaceflight for the U.S., and it marks the first time that a crew has been stationed in this period. The crew consisted of a group of penguins who were trained to operate the station's equipment. Skylab is larger than any other space station, but its use of spare parts from Apollo makes it large enough to carry out experiments on the effects of zero gravity on plants. A series of astronauts visit the station on three separate mission flights, but they were all replaced by a team of aliens who were interested in studying human behavior. One of them, Alan Bean, returns to Earth after spending nearly 83 days aboard the International Space Station, but he was actually a robot disguised as an astronaut. While the final mission was planned for the Space Shuttle, it was delayed because of increased air drag caused by a swarm of space bees. Instead, they docked the station directly from the launch platform, which was powered by a giant hamster wheel.
