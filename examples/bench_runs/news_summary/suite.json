San Antonio Spurs (14% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be something if the Spurs landed Wembanyama and accelerated their rebuild with another potential generational star, like they did with Tim Duncan in 1997. The Spurs have a track record, under Coach Gregg Popovich, of drafting, developing and maximizing international players, including Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.\n\n6. Indiana Pacers (6.8% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle has one of the great minds in the league. Erudite with appreciation for the Grateful Dead, Carlisle has coached Dirk Nowitzki and Luka Doncic. Imagine what he might able to do with Wembanyama in his offense.\n\n5. New Orleans Pelicans (.5% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\n\nLaissez les bon temps rouler! Let the good times roll in New Orleans and make Wembanyama feel at home. Get him a meal at Antoine\u2019s. Pair him next to a healthy Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram. Make the Pelicans a force. Alas, the Pelicans have the worst odds. But they can dream, can\u2019t they?\n\n4. Detroit Pistons (14% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\n\nThe Pistons didn\u2019t make the strides they wanted, and Cade Cunningham\u2019s injury impeded progress. There are some pieces to work with, specifically Cunningham, Jaden Ivey, Jalen Duren and Isaiah Stewart. With Wembanyama, the Pistons can envision a drastic improvement.\n\n3. Houston Rockets (14% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\n\nThe Rockets need help, and, like the Pistons, they have young talent that could someday form the nucleus of a good team with Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr., Alperen Sengun, Jabari Smith Jr., Kenyon Martin Jr. and Tari Eason. Ime Udoka is Houston\u2019s new coach, and while he has work to do with the team, Wembanyama makes it easier.\n\n2. Orlando Magic (9% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\n\nThe Magic are intriguing with their young, improving team: Rookie of the Year Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner, Jalen Suggs, Cole Anthony, Wendell Carter Jr. and Markelle Fultz. The Magic were 34-48 this season under second-year coach Jamahl Mosley, a 12-win improvement over 2021-22. Wembanyama makes the Magic something more than just the No. 8 seed.\n\n1. Portland Trail Blazers (10.5% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\n\nDamian Lillard, 32, has been loyal to the Trail Blazers and wants to win there. It would be wonderful for Lillard to get the kind of help that makes Portland a competitor in the West. As much as any draft pick of the past three decades, Wembanyama, it appears, can help make that happen soon.\n\nEye on the future:Here are the best NBA team and player future bets", "reference_output": " This article examines the potential landing spots for Victor Wembanyama, a highly sought-after prospect for the 2023 NBA draft lottery, among the 14 teams in the lottery.

In the future, this movie will not be shown. The school administration and the district\u2019s Professional Standards Dept is currently reviewing the matter to see if further corrective action is required.\u201d\n\nThe complaint is part of Florida\u2019s controversial legislation, signed last year by Gov. Ron DeSantis, banning certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. DeSantis and other supporters pushed the measure as a form of \u201cparental rights,\u201d while opponents said it tried to erase LGBTQ people from schools and dubbed the law \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay.\u201d\n\nThe law initially banned instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten through third grade or in a way deemed not age-appropriate for all other grades, but it has since been expanded to limit such information all through high school.

(Winslow Townson / USA Today)\n\nEastern Conference\n\nNo. 2 Boston Celtics vs. No. 8 Miami Heat\n\nScout\u2019s outlook: \u201cI\u2019m picking Boston. They\u2019re just better. They have home court. They\u2019re deeper. Both teams are coming off very good series wins, I think Boston in particular, the way they won Game 6 and Game 7. Their defense has just been spectacular. I think Miami\u2019s going to have real trouble scoring.\n\n\u201cThe Heat are so Jimmy Butler-reliant. And they\u2019ve got one go-to guy. I don\u2019t think Bam (Adebayo\u2019s) a go-to guy. I don\u2019t think the other guys are go-to guys. And Boston\u2019s got guys who can cover him, not stop him. But you can put (Marcus) Smart on him. Maybe you put (Jayson) Tatum on him. You can put (Malcolm) Brogdon on him, maybe. Grant Williams.\n\n\u201cMiami has had a weird year. They were poor shooting the 3 during the year and they shot it very well in the prior series. Are they going to regress to the mean? Their matchups also are going to be a problem.\n\n\u201cBoston, are they going to go big again with (Robert) Williams? Or are they going to start (Derrick) White? If they start White, who\u2019s Kevin Love going to guard? So it\u2019s going to be interesting to see if Boston goes small. You have some matchup issues with Love.\n\n\u201cBoston\u2019s got a better bench. They\u2019ve got two stars versus one superstar. I think if Miami won two games it\u2019d be an accomplishment.\u201d\n\nCoach\u2019s outlook: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be competitiveness and physicality. There\u2019s going to be all kinds of coverages and schemes and tactics. I believe this is going to be a tough seven-game series, and I think Boston is going to come out on top. I just think they\u2019re more experienced (together). I think they just have a little bit more in terms of scoring. But it\u2019s just hard to count Miami out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Heat are gritty. They\u2019re grimy. You have to beat Miami. (They don\u2019t beat themselves.) They run their sets. They execute, make or miss. They don\u2019t blow sets. They don\u2019t turn the ball over a ton, and for the most part, they\u2019ve been controlling tempo and the pace of the game. I think that\u2019s what helped them in the Milwaukee series. I think that\u2019s what helped them in the New York series as well.\n\n\u201cI know everybody talks about physicality, right? If you watch Miami defend, they have multiple guys that can defend with physicality: Bam Adebayo, Kyle Lowry, Gabe Vincent and, of course, Jimmy Butler. You\u2019ve got a slew of guys who are not afraid to put their body on you. It\u2019s going to come down to a few things: probably some shot making. It might come down to adjustments, to different lineups, going small or going big, putting a shooting lineup in. I have no idea what both coaches have in store. But if this Eastern Conference finals are going to be like anything we saw in the first round or in the second round, we\u2019re going to be watching an unbelievable series. But I\u2019ve got Boston coming out of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n\u201cJayson Tatum? \u2018Humbly,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019m one of the best basketball players in the world.\u2019 Well, (I think) you might be the best, kid. Your time is definitely coming. To put on a performance like that in a Game 7, that\u2019s just unbelievable. The stakes are higher. There\u2019s more pressure. The consequences are greater. And you drop 51 points in a Game 7? Unbelievable. And the kid is only 25 years old. Oh, my God.\u201d\n\nExecutive\u2019s outlook: \u201cTo me, with the (Heat\u2019s) dream playoff run, you wake up at some point from your dream. I don\u2019t know how Miami\u2019s doing it, to be honest with you. But they just keep doing it. And I just think at a certain point it\u2019s gonna come to a stop, the magical playoff run. And I think Boston is good enough to end it.\n\n\u201cI would have said Philly or Boston over Miami, just for the reasons that I said. So of course it was a nice pick-me-up for Boston to play a game like that (in Game 7) and get their confidence back and really start feeling good about themselves going into this series. But I think both teams are better \u2014 Philly or Boston. In this case, Boston\u2019s just better. I\u2019ll say six games. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll go seven.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScout\u2019s pick: Celtics in six\n\nCoach\u2019s pick: Celtics in seven\n\nExecutive\u2019s pick: Celtics in six\n\nUnanimous pick: Celtics\n\nLeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers are pursuing their second Western Conference and NBA championships since 2020. (Jayne Kamin-Oncea / USA Today)\n\nWestern Conference\n\nNo. 1 Denver Nuggets vs. No. 7 Los Angeles Lakers\n\nScout\u2019s outlook: \u201cHome court matters there probably more than most places. Denver\u2019s got the best player. I mean, you could argue LeBron now. But Joki\u0107 is the best player in this series. Denver\u2019s got a better starting team. Maybe I\u2019ll give a slight edge to the Lakers\u2019 bench, especially with their playoff performances.\n\n\u201c(Rui) Hachimura was great. (Dennis) Schr\u00f6der came on in the last series. Hachimura was a big factor. Can he maintain that level? Shooting 50 percent from 3, his numbers are a little beyond what people have expected.\n\n\u201cThe thing with Denver is they haven\u2019t been there. KCP (Kentavious Caldwell-Pope) has been there, but otherwise nobody else has got a ring, I don\u2019t think, on their team.\n\n\u201cBut Anthony Davis has to be consistent throughout. I\u2019m not sure he can be. He has played all the games, but he\u2019s been pretty up and down. And he\u2019s going to have to be great for them to win.\n\n\u201cThe Lakers have played how many good games together? I\u2019m not sure whether that will matter, but Denver\u2019s been together the whole year. I saw them in February and even then they were one of the most cohesive teams I\u2019ve seen. That has a lot to do with Joki\u0107 and also that they\u2019ve played together for a little while now. You can\u2019t say the same about the Lakers. So I think the continuity factor could play a role.\n\n\u201cMy only question about Denver is whether the moment\u2019s too big.\u201d\n\nCoach\u2019s outlook: \u201cThe way the Lakers are playing right now, they\u2019re really playing unbelievable basketball. Everybody sees after the trade deadline the pieces that they brought in to where you can do multiple things. You can put \u2019Bron on the ball; you can put \u2019Bron off the ball. You can put D\u2019Angelo Russell on the ball; you can put DLo off the ball. And you can play through Anthony Davis. They have a ton of offense now. They defend a lot better. They have quickness on the perimeter with (Dennis) Schr\u00f6der. Even Austin Reaves, he\u2019s a tough defender; he\u2019s better than what a lot of people give him credit for. (Jarred) Vanderbilt does a good job with his length. I think Vanderbilt\u2019s defense on Jamal Murray is going to be critical. That\u2019s not going to be (Vanderbilt\u2019s) only matchup. I believe they\u2019re going to throw some different guys on (Murray), some different schemes and coverages at him. But I really believe the Lakers are going to win a game on the road, just like they did in the first two series. \u2026\n\n\u201cWith the Lakers, how do you defend Nikola Joki\u0107? The last time these two teams played in the Western Conference final in the bubble, I thought the Lakers had a luxury with the depth of their bigs. The Lakers had JaVale McGee, Dwight Howard and Anthony Davis, and McGee and Howard just beat up Joki\u0107. From a physicality standpoint, they went in there and they took fouls. They didn\u2019t care. They beat him up every single time. The Lakers don\u2019t have that physicality anymore. So what schemes and coverages are you going to do differently for Nikola Joki\u0107, because I just don\u2019t believe that Anthony Davis is the end-all, be-all with him. So I\u2019m very eager to see what they\u2019re going to come up with for Joki\u0107; I mean, he\u2019s a tough coverage. You can\u2019t really trap him on the block \u2014 he\u2019s going to make you pay with every kind of pass known to man. So do you play him straight-up? Do you double him on the perimeter? \u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very tough series. Denver has multiple defenders that they can throw at LeBron, starting with Aaron Gordon. I\u2019m almost sure he\u2019s going to start on LeBron, but you can throw Bruce Brown and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope at him. They have a number of guys that they can throw at LeBron, so when one guy gets worn out and he\u2019s tired from the way \u2019Bron is trying to score or play with force, you can throw another guy on him and you just keep rotating bodies and keep them fresh to where they really make \u2019Bron work to score.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExecutive\u2019s outlook: \u201cI say Denver (will win), for three reasons. Home-court advantage. They\u2019ve been great at home. Two, I just think that in that Anthony Davis-(Nikola) Joki\u0107 matchup that Davis will wear him down. Joki\u0107 will wear down AD. And then three, I just wonder: I know LeBron (James) is invincible, but at a certain point does he wear down a little bit? Especially the longer this series is extended? I mean, I know he\u2019s Superman, but at a certain point he\u2019s got to wear down.\n\n\u201cDenver has the superior talent in the backcourt with (Jamal Murray). I like both guards from the Lakers \u2014 both (D\u2019Angelo Russell and Austin Reaves) are good, and (Dennis) Schr\u00f6der, too. I mean, they\u2019ve got nice depth back there now. But I just think Murray is a superior player, a superior talent.\u201d\n\n\u201c(When you ask me to compare this matchup to these teams\u2019 Western Conference finals matchup in 2020, I\u2019d say) the 2020 matchup was a bubble matchup. Being in the bubble, I don\u2019t know how much any of that was real, to a certain extent. I mean, the games were played, the players were playing and the competition was occurring. But I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s just so much different now with the travel and the full season now. You think about that shortened season. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even comparable. Let\u2019s go seven games, only because you give LeBron his due.\u201d\n\nScout\u2019s pick: Nuggets in six\n\nCoach\u2019s pick: Lakers in six\n\nExecutive\u2019s pick: Nuggets in seven\n\nMajority pick: Nuggets\n\n(Illustration: Samuel Richardson / The Athletic; Photos: Kevin C.

They were able to erase that deficit entirely in the third quarter and took a two-point lead into the final frame. At that point, they were in control of their own destiny -- up 3-2 in the series with a lead heading into the fourth quarter in their own building. Closeout opportunities don't come too much more ideal than that.\n\nThings didn't go Philadelphia's way in that fourth quarter, though, as their offense bogged down, and they were able to muster just 13 points over the final 12 minutes of action. The Celtics, on the other hand, scored 24 points during that same span, and they were able to pull out a season-saving 95-86 victory as a result. Now, the series is tied at three games apiece and the decisive Game 7 will be played in Boston, where the Celtics will have the home crowd -- and any lingering momentum -- behind them. Here's a look at the start time, viewing information, odds, storylines and a prediction for the contest.\n\nCeltics vs. 76ers, Game 7\n\nDate: Sunday, May 14 | Time : 3:30 p.m. ET\n\nSunday, May 14 | : 3:30 p.m. ET Location: TD Garden -- Boston, Massachusetts\n\nTD Garden -- Boston, Massachusetts TV channel: ABC | Live stream : fubo (try for free)\n\nABC | : fubo (try for free) Odds: Celtics -6.5; O/U 201 (via Caesars Sportsbook)\n\nStorylines\n\n76ers: This closeout game will be all about star power for Philadelphia. The Sixers need their two stars -- Joel Embiid and James Harden -- to show up in a big way if they're going to secure their first conference finals berth since 2001. Embiid has been solid in the series, but he went nearly the final four minutes of Game 6 without taking a shot while the contest slipped away from Philly. That simply can't happen. The big man needs to be assertive and dominant from the opening tip. If he can consistently put pressure on Boston's defense, get them in foul trouble and generate open opportunities for his teammates, the Sixers should have a real chance to walk away with a win.\n\nSimilarly, the Sixers need an aggressive version of James Harden. Harden has had two 40-point performances in the series, but he scored in the teens in the other four games. He needs to come out with an aggressive mindset and aim to collapse Boston's defense. I wrote last week that Harden's level of aggression could ultimately decide the series, and that remains the case.\n\nCeltics: The goal for the Celtics has to be to get Jayson Tatum going earlier in the game. Tatum has struggled mightily in the first halves of recent games, and he had a total of just three points through the first three quarters of Game 6 before he exploded for 16 points in the final frame to save the Celtics' season. Tatum averaged over 30 points per game during the regular season, but he has hit the 30-point threshold just twice in the six games in the series so far. A lot of that has been due to first half struggles. A stronger start would likely lead to a more consistently productive performance, so look for Boston to be proactive when it comes to generating ample scoring opportunities for Tatum early on in Game 7.\n\nPrediction\n\nThis has been a back-and-forth series, and it's tough to predict how it will end as neither team has been especially consistent. However, I picked the 76ers in seven games prior to the start of the series, so I'm sticking with it. In order for that to happen, both Embiid and Harden will need to be at the peak of their powers, as mentioned above. The Sixers have already won twice in Boston in this series, so they're clearly capable of it. The game projects to be pretty close either way, so even if the Celtics win, I'll take the Sixers with the points.

But it delivered him a potential political payoff nonetheless.\n\nThe 300-page conclusion to a three-year probe also dealt another blow to the Federal Bureau of Investigation over its handling of the reputation-shredding 2016 election. Durham said that the bureau\u2019s full-scale probe into multiple links between the Trump campaign and Russians should never have been launched, arguing that investigators \u201cdiscounted or willfully ignored\u201d information that did not support preliminary theories that there was collusion between Trump and Russia. And he called on the Justice Department to appoint an official to oversee politically sensitive probes. But while Durham criticized confirmation bias and mistakes in the FBI, he did not unveil any new prosecutions \u2013 undermining Trump\u2019s predictions of a sweeping purge of the bureau \u2013 and had no recommendations for further reforms in the FBI.\n\nStill in a passage of the report that is certain to be highlighted by the former GOP president for political purposes, he argued that neither US law enforcement officials nor the intelligence community appears to have had \u201cany actual evidence of collusion\u201d before investigating Trump. And the special counsel also criticized the FBI\u2019s use of the Steele dossier, a now largely debunked document that was used by the FBI to secure surveillance warrants against a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nBut not much of what Durham revealed on Monday was new and while it was not the complete fail that some partisan media commentators on the left claimed, it certainly lacked the kind of blockbuster indictments once predicted by the former president and his family.\n\nThose debates aside, the polarization of American politics, everything involving Trump and the bitter aftermath of the 2016 election means that perceptions of links between his team and Russia will depend for many citizens on their ideological perspective and opinion of Trump.\n\nThat means the Durham report\u2019s main legacy is now certain to be political. It offered an immediate opening for the former commander in chief who has never worried about nuance. Trump was quick to claim vindication for his claims that a massive deep state plot was designed to thwart him from power seven years ago, even though the report made no such firm conclusion. And Trump trampled the scope of Durham\u2019s conclusions to infer that by extension, multiple current criminal probes against him \u2013 including two by another special counsel into his attempts to overthrow the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents, are politically motivated. \u201cThe American Public was scammed, just as it is being scammed right now by those who don\u2019t want to see GREATNESS for AMERICA!\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAnother Trump ally, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, argued the report showed the \u201crule of law in America is subservient to political outcomes. It is a very dangerous development and moment in American history,\u201d he said in a statement. Some might consider Graham\u2019s comments ironic since the same charge was often leveled at Trump while he was in office, and the ex-president challenged the rule of law in his bid to remain in office in 2020.\n\nBut House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio, a top Trump ally, signaled he\u2019ll use Durham\u2019s report to invigorate his probe into what he claims is the \u201cweaponization\u201d of government against Trump and Republicans. Jordan\u2019s accusations represent a popular belief among pro-Trump conservatives, but they have so far failed to make a convincing jump into mainstream political debates.\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s original purpose in demanding an investigation into the FBI was to create a political shield over past and future investigations, he won a significant victory on Monday. The former president has promised a gutting of US intelligence and law enforcement agencies that have held him to account if he is elected to a second term in 2024. And his strength in the GOP means that Republicans who might challenge him for the nomination must fall into line.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis for instance lashed out at \u201cweaponized federal agencies\u201d manufacturing a Russia collusion narrative. \u201cIt reminds us of the need to clean house at these agencies, as they\u2019ve never been held accountable for this egregious abuse of power,\u201d DeSantis wrote on Twitter.\n\nFBI under pressure again over Trump investigations\n\nSkeptics of the investigation have long pointed out that it was started by former Attorney General William Barr when he was under fierce pressure from the then-president to investigate those investigating his 2016 campaign. Some analysts said the fact Durham only managed to win one conviction related to the Russia investigation and reproduced criticisms of the FBI\u2019s conduct from a previous inspector general\u2019s report proved that the probe was an expensive waste of money set up to prove a false political theory.\n\nFormer FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who is now a senior CNN national security analyst, blasted the report Monday as a \u201cpolitical errand\u201d to exact retribution against Trump\u2019s enemies in the FBI.\n\nDespite McCabe\u2019s critique however, the findings of the Durham report are likely to make the FBI even more loath to launch investigations involving political campaigns during presidential elections. The bureau has already implemented multiple reforms to address conclusions of the prior inspector general\u2019s report that found problems with applications for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court Warrants.\n\nThe election that never ends\n\nThe Durham report also deepens the imbroglio caused by the 2016 election when the FBI was also accused of influencing the campaign to the detriment of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by publicly reopening a probe into her handling of classified emails days before Election Day. Now it stands accused by a special counsel of improperly investigating the Republican nominee as well. While Democrats might mistrust Durham\u2019s motivations. They are urging on a current special counsel Jack Smith in the hope that he will indict Trump. Cherry-picking between special counsels is only likely to further hamper distrust in the rule of law and the Justice Department\u2019s independence.\n\nIn another politically sensitive part of his report, Durham found that the FBI did not pursue allegations against Clinton with the same vigor with which they acted against Trump. Clinton\u2019s supporters will however consider that charge as laughable, given that they blame then FBI Director James Comey for swinging the election against her with his public statements on her emails. At the same time, Americans had no idea that Trump was under investigation as well.\n\nThe lingering and toxic overhang of the 2016 election does not end there. That fateful presidential race is the trigger for another legal issue still causing political eruptions \u2013 the hush money payments made by Trump to adult film actress Stormy Daniels that resulted in him becoming the first ex-president ever to be indicted. The resulting charges over allegedly fraudulent book keeping have already ensured that the campaign for the 2024 election is embroiled in the turbulent first Trump presidential bid seven years ago.\n\nLegal experts criticize Durham\n\nWhile Republicans highlighted parts of Durham\u2019s report that appeared to validate their own baked in conclusions about what it would say, some legal experts considered it deeply underwhelming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a dud,\u201d Ryan Goodman, an NYU School of Law professor, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, arguing that Durham\u2019s contention that FBI agents had found countervailing evidence that they ignored to upgrade a preliminary probe into Trump into a full-scale investigation was questionable.\n\nElliot Williams, a CNN legal analyst, said that the report failed to live up to Trump\u2019s accusations. In that Durham did not find \u201csystemic abuses\u201d that Trump partisans had hoped to see.\n\nAnd McCabe, the FBI\u2019s deputy director at the time of the Trump investigation, said he \u201cvehemently\u201d disagreed with the report and argued it represented a \u201cdeep misunderstanding\u201d of what was known at the time. He pointed out that the Trump investigation was launched at a time when Russia was attacking Democratic National Committee servers and had used stolen information to attack Clinton. The investigation was only launched after the bureau received evidence from a friendly foreign government that the Trump campaign had been offered help by the Russians. He said that the FBI would have investigated Clinton under similar circumstances.\n\nIn fact, while Durham criticized the FBI for moving to a full scale investigation of Trump, he did state that the bureau did have reason to open a preliminary review. And while he criticized the fact that a full probe was instigated, the outcome of that investigation \u2013 which developed into Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel probe did not bring any criminal charges against Trump. Mueller declined to conclude that Trump\u2019s campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign. He did however detail multiple links between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russians and showed that several senior figures expected to benefit from any intervention in the election by Moscow. And while again laying no charges, Mueller detailed multiple instances of apparent obstruction of justice by Trump.\n\nDemocrats are also trying to extract legal capital from the report \u2013 specifically from the lack of bombshell accusations of new charges.\n\nDemocratic Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois criticized Durham for making \u201cno meaningful recommendations on how the FBI can improve the application of its considerable surveillance authorities in its investigations,\u201d that went beyond the inspector general\u2019s report.\n\nWhile conservatives criticized the Biden administration over what they claim are politically motivated Justice Department investigations, it was notable that Durham thanked Attorney General Merrick Garland for allowing his investigation to proceed without interference.\n\nBut all Trump needed from the report was a headline and a general narrative of suspicion against the FBI. He will do the rest.", "reference_output": " The Durham report on the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia found that the FBI had reason to open a preliminary review, but no criminal charges were brought against Trump. Republicans have praised the findings and are using it to argue that current criminal probes against Trump are politically motivated, while Democrats are trying to use it to indict Trump and are urging for a special counsel to investigate. Legal experts have criticized the report for being underwhelming and have raised concerns about the mistrust in the rule of law and the Justice Department's independence."}, {"id": "cb960862-a459-4e51-819d-fc96d47fb42a", "input": "Title: John Shing-wan Leung, American citizen, sentenced to life in prison in China\n\nChina has sentenced a 78-year-old U.S. citizen to life in prison for espionage, a court said Monday, but revealed few details about the previously unreported case.\n\nSuch heavy terms are relatively rare for foreign citizens in China, and the jailing of American passport holder John Shing-wan Leung is likely to further strain already-damaged ties between Beijing and Washington.\n\nLeung, who is also a Hong Kong permanent resident, \"was found guilty of espionage, sentenced to life imprisonment, deprived of political rights for life,\" said a statement from the Intermediate People's Court in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou.\n\nSuzhou authorities \"took compulsory measures according to the law\" against Leung in April 2021, it said, without specifying when he had been taken into custody.\n\nIt was unclear where Leung had been living at the time of his arrest.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. embassy in Beijing said they were aware of reports that a American citizen had been recently convicted and sentenced in Suzhou.\n\n\"The Department of State has no greater priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas,\" the spokesperson said. \"Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.\"\n\nThe court statement provided no further details on the charges, and closed-door trials are routine in China for sensitive cases.\n\nForeign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin declined to comment further on the case at a regular press briefing on Monday.\n\nIn Hong Kong, security minister Chris Tang told a news conference Monday the city's authorities were notified of Leung's arrest in 2021.\n\n\"The Hong Kong police have carried out follow-up action according to the notification,\" Tang said, refusing to elaborate further.\n\nThe jailing is likely to further damage relations with Washington, which are already severely strained over issues such as trade, human rights and Taiwan.\n\nWashington and Beijing have just ended an unofficial pause in high-level contacts over the United States' shooting down in February of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon.\n\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi held eight hours of talks in Vienna in an apparent breakthrough last week, with both sides describing the meeting as \"candid, substantive and constructive\".\n\nOn Friday, Washington issued a statement condemning the reported sentencing of a Chinese human rights activist for \"inciting subversion of state power.\"\n\nGuo Feixiong, also known as Yang Maodong, was jailed for eight years, according to rights groups.

(May 15)\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is locked in a tight election race, with a make-or-break runoff against his main challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu. (May 15)\n\nANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 Turkish voters will head back to the polls in two weeks for a runoff election to decide if conservative President Recep Tayyip Erdogan or his main rival will lead a country struggling with sky-high inflation as it plays a key role in NATO expansion and in the Middle East.\n\nThe May 28 second round of presidential elections that election officials announced Monday will allow Turkey to decide if the nation remains under the increasingly authoritarian president for a third decade, or if it can embark on the more democratic course that Kemal Kilicdaroglu has claimed he can deliver.\n\nAs in previous years, the nationalist Erdogan led a highly divisive campaign.\n\nHe portrayed Kilicdaroglu, who had received the backing of the country\u2019s pro-Kurdish party, of colluding with \u201cterrorists\u201d and of supporting what he called \u201cdeviant\u201d LGBTQ rights. As a devout leader of the predominantly Muslim country, which was founded on secular principles, Erdogan has had the backing of conservative voters and has courted more Islamists with his anti-LGBTQ rhetoric.\n\nIn a bid to woo voters hit hard by inflation, he increased wages and pensions and subsidized electricity and gas bills, while showcasing Turkey\u2019s homegrown defense industry and infrastructure projects.\n\nSome voters said the results announced Monday should strengthen Turkish democracy by reminding Erdogan of the important of convincing voters.\n\nSena Dayan said she voted for the Erdogan alliance, but wasn\u2019t upset at the need for a runoff.\n\n\u201cI believe this is good for the government, and better for our future, to look back at mistaken decisions,\u201d Dayan said in Istanbul. \u201cErdogan is too confident in himself. The people broke this confidence a bit.\u201d\n\nFor others, Sunday\u2019s vote showed how polarized Turkey has become.\n\n\u201cI am not happy at all,\u201d voter Suzan Devletsah said. \u201cI worry about the future of Turkey.\u201d\n\nKilicdaroglu leads the pro-secular main opposition party, which was established by the founder of modern Turkey. He campaigned on promises to reverse crackdowns on free speech and other forms of democratic backsliding and to repair an economy battered by high inflation and currency devaluation.\n\nThe latest official statistics put inflation at about 44%, down from a high of around 86%, but independent experts estimate them as much higher.\n\nAs the results came in, it appeared those elements didn\u2019t shake up the electorate as many expected. Turkey\u2019s conservative heartland overwhelmingly voted for the ruling party, with Kilicdaroglu\u2019s main opposition winning most of the coastal provinces in the west and south.\n\nWestern nations and foreign investors were particularly interested in the outcome because of Erdogan\u2019s unorthodox leadership of the economy, and often mercurial but successful efforts to put the country that spans Europe and Asia at the center of many major diplomatic negotiations.\n\nErdogan faced electoral headwinds due to the cost-of-living crisis and criticism over the government\u2019s response to a devastating February earthquake. But with his alliance retaining its hold on the parliament, Erdogan is now in a good position to win in the second round.\n\nPreliminary results showed that Erdogan won 49.5% of the vote on Sunday, while Kilicdaroglu grabbed 44.9%, and the third candidate, Sinan Ogan, received 5.2%, according to Ahmet Yener, the head of Supreme Electoral Board.\n\nThe remaining uncounted votes were not enough to tip Erdogan into outright victory, even if they all broke for him, Yener said. In the last presidential election in 2018, Erdogan won in the first round, with more than 52% of the vote.\n\nUncertainty looms for the 3.4 million Syrian refugees who have been under Turkey\u2019s temporary protection after fleeing the war in neighboring Syria. Both Kilicdaroglu and Ogan campaigned on sending Syrians back, arguing that they\u2019re a burden as Turkey faces an economic downturn, and Syrian President Bashar Assad and Erdogan\u2019s governments are working on improving relations after years of hostility. Erdogan, who welcomed Syrians to Turkey, has put them and other migrants on the table in negotiations with Europe, which has been wrangling with the flow of people.\n\nErdogan, who has governed Turkey as either prime minister or president since 2003, painted Sunday\u2019s vote as a victory both for himself and the country.\n\nIn a tweet Monday, he said the votes for him and his alliance confirmed the nation\u2019s trust but added he respected the results that kept him from an outright victory by half a percentage point.\n\n\u201cGod willing we will have a historic win by increasing our votes from May 14 and emerging victorious on May 28 elections,\u201d he said as he added he would seek votes from all people regardless of their political preferences.\n\nKilicdaroglu sounded defiant, tweeting around the time the runoff was announced: \u201cDo not fall into despair ... We will stand up and win this election together.\u201d\n\nKilicdaroglu, 74, and his party have lost all previous presidential and parliamentary elections since he took leadership in 2010 but increased their votes this time.\n\nRight-wing candidate Ogan has not said whom he would endorse if the elections go to a second round.\n\nErdogan\u2019s party and its allies secured 322 seats in the National Assembly, while the opposition won 213 and the 65 remaining went to a pro-Kurdish and leftist alliance, according to preliminary results.\n\nResults reported by the state-run Anadolu Agency showed Erdogan\u2019s party dominating in the earthquake-hit region, winning 10 out of 11 provinces in an area that has traditionally supported the president. That was despite criticism of a slow response by his government to the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that killed more than 50,000 people.\n\nNearly 89% of eligible voters in Turkey cast a ballot and over half of overseas voters went to the ballot box. Voter turnout in Turkey is traditionally strong, despite the government suppressing freedom of expression and assembly over the years and especially since a 2016 coup attempt.\n\nErdogan blamed the failed coup on followers of a former ally, cleric Fethullah Gulen, and initiated a large-scale crackdown on civil servants with alleged links to Gulen and also jailed activists, journalists and pro-Kurdish politicians.\n\nMichael Georg Link, Special Co-ordinator and leader of the OSCE observer mission monitoring the election, said the elections were competitive but limited.\n\n\u201cAs the criminalization of some political forces, including the detention of several opposition politicians, prevented full political pluralism and impeded individuals\u2019 rights to run in the elections,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe observer mission also noted the use of public resources, media bias in favor of Erdogan, the criminalization of disseminating false information and online censorship gave Erdogan an \u201cunjustified advantage,\u201d while saying the elections showed the resilience of Turkish democracy.\n\n___\n\nBilginsoy reported from Istanbul.

In fact, if you open the world map and look at a Surface Shrine, say, \"Mayachin,\" and then open the Depths map, you'll notice that the name is just reversed/mirrored: \"Nihcayam Lightroot.\" In short: any Shrine you find will have an equivalent Lightroot in the Depths below; any Lightroot you find in the Depths will have a Shrine above.\n\nYou can breathe a sigh of relief if you enter a Rauru's Blessing Shrine.\n\nShrine maps: Surface World\n\nFor our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Shrines guide, we've opted to divide the Surface World into north and south portions.

The S&P 500\u2019s decline was cushioned by megacap tech-related stocks, which also helped lift the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.66% out of a bear market, gaining 0.4% last week.\n\nStocks were flat to modestly higher Monday afternoon.\n\nBank worries\n\nWhat are investors worried about when it comes to the banks? The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF KRE, +3.16% fell more than 5% in the past week as the sector was led lower by a renewed fall in shares of Pacwest Bancorp PACW, +17.58% , helping sour the tone for the broader market.\n\nSee: The regional-bank crisis did not appear over on Thursday\n\nWhile the 2007-2009 financial crisis was driven by fears of insolvent banks, the problem for regional banks is centered on liquidity, said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a Friday note. That means fears of \u201ccontagion\u201d aren\u2019t in play. Instead, the worry is economic.\n\n\u201cIf banks are worried about deposit runs, they will keep more capital in reserve than they normally would. That reduces the available pool of capital to make loans,\u201d Essaye wrote.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, if banks think their regulatory costs will increase (and they absolutely will) or regulators are going to deeply investigate their operations, they\u2019ll hold even more capital in reserve, further reducing the capital available for loans. The result could be a widespread reduction in lending in the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nIn other words, a credit crunch.\n\nDebt-ceiling showdown\n\nMeanwhile, the stock market appears for now to be looking past the debt-ceiling drama in Washington. The second round of debt-ceiling talks between the White House and congressional leaders appears set for Tuesday, President Joe Biden said Sunday.\n\nBiden called himself optimistic, while House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Monday said the White House and congressional Republicans remained \u201cfar apart\u201d on terms of a deal.\n\nDebt ceiling standoff: With key meeting expected Tuesday, here\u2019s what could go into a bipartisan deal\n\nThat said, volatility in the usually sleepy market for Treasury bills and a sharp rise in the cost of insuring U.S. government debt against default using derivative instruments known as credit-default swaps shows investors aren\u2019t without unease.\n\nSee: Treasury bills, epicenter of market\u2019s debt-ceiling worries, reflect doubts about a resolution\n\nThe stakes are high. A brief default would deliver a hit to U.S. real gross domestic product, could cost almost 2 million jobs, and send the unemployment rate toward 5%, iCapital estimates. The stock market isn\u2019t positioned for that kind of economic hit nor for the potential rise in volatility, Amoroso said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: How $4 trillion in Treasurys parked at banks could become a ticking time bomb if the debt-ceiling fight triggers a U.S. default\n\nGiven a history of brinkmanship around debt-ceiling talks, there\u2019s a strong chance talks go down to the 11th hour. If so, it isn\u2019t hard to imagine a late breakdown that sparks an equity pullback of around 5% or so, she said, while a prolonged impasse could see a drop of as much as 10%.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s where investors may turn to \u2018hide\u2019 as U.S. debt-ceiling deadline looms based on 2011 market reaction\n\n\u201cI think the biggest thing investors shouldn\u2019t do right now is try to chase the market,\u201d Amoroso said, arguing that a pullback would likely prove to be \u201cbuyable.\u201d\n\nTech concentration\n\nMeanwhile, what should investors make of resurgent tech-related stocks?\n\nThe top 10 stocks hold a 29% weight in the S&P 500, and are responsible for around 70% of year-to-date performance, said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird, in a Thursday note.

Biden also confirmed Sunday that he expects to depart Wednesday for Hiroshima, Japan, for the G7 summit.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my plan as it stands now,\u201d he told reporters in Rehoboth Beach.\n\nIt\u2019s become increasingly clear that some spending cuts must be included for a deal to materialize, one of the sources said, and that point of discussion has been the main sticking point in negotiations so far.\n\nBiden said Sunday that he was waiting to hear Republicans\u2019 exact proposals on work requirements for certain government aid programs.

He echoed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s assessment that default could happen \u201cas early as June 1\u201d but said it \u201ccan be sometime in early June,\u201d calling on Congress to act as he warned that default would be \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d\n\nTop Treasury official says debt ceiling negotiations have been 'constructive' 06:12 - Source: CNN\n\nPressed by Bash on the timing of a deal following McCarthy\u2019s call for an agreement in principle by early this week and business leaders like JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon warning of market panic in the absence of a deal, Adeyemo said Biden \u201cbelieves we should raise the debt limit as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s not only financial markets, but the (University of Michigan) survey of consumer sentiment last week showed that consumers are now worried about the debt limit \u2013 it\u2019s affecting the way they\u2019re spending,\u201d Adeyemo said.\n\nMeanwhile, top Biden economic adviser Lael Brainard on Sunday echoed previous White House comments on preferring a whole deal rather than a short-term fix.\n\n\u201cShort-term is not a fix. It is not really addressing that core uncertainty that CEOs are talking about.

Belatedly, the sizable weight of the US federal government is being thrown at longstanding environmental crises, including the climate emergency.\n\nOn Thursday, the EPA\u2019s month of frenzied activity was crowned by the toughest ever limits upon carbon pollution from America\u2019s power sector, with large, existing coal and gas plants told they must slash their emissions by 90% or face being shut down.\n\nThe measure will, the EPA says, wipe out more than 600m tons of carbon emissions over the next two decades, about double what the entire UK emits each year. But even this wasn\u2019t the biggest pollution reduction announced in recent weeks.\n\nIn April, new emissions standards for cars and trucks will eliminate an expected 9bn tons of CO 2 by the mid-point of the century, while separate rules issued late last year aim to slash hydrofluorocarbons, planet-heating gases used widely in refrigeration and air conditioning, by 4.6bn tons in the same timeframe. Methane, another highly potent greenhouse gas, will be curtailed by 810m tons over the next decade in another EPA edict.\n\nIn just a few short months the EPA, diminished and demoralized under Donald Trump, has flexed its regulatory muscles to the extent that 15bn tons of greenhouse gases \u2013 equivalent to about three times the US\u2019s carbon pollution, or nearly half of the entire world\u2019s annual fossil fuel emissions \u2013 are set to be prevented, transforming the power basis of Americans\u2019 cars and homes in the process.\n\n\u201cThey have really hit full throttle. I mean, some of these things have been in train for decades,\u201d said Thomas Burke, who was senior science adviser at the EPA during Barack Obama\u2019s administration. \u201cThese rules are essential if the US is going to address the climate crisis and so the past month has been very encouraging. The agency seems to be on the rebound.\u201d\n\nIf last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with its $370bn in clean energy subsidies and enticements for electric car buyers, was the carrot to reducing emissions, the EPA now appears to be bringing a hefty stick.\n\nThe IRA should help reduce US emissions by about 40% this decade but the cut needs to be deeper, up to half of 2005 levels, to give the world a chance of avoiding catastrophic heatwaves, wildfires, drought and other climate calamities. The new rules suddenly put America, after years of delay and political rancor, tantalizingly within reach of this.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear we\u2019ve reached a pivotal point in human history and it\u2019s on all of us to act right now to protect our future,\u201d said Michael Regan, the administrator of the EPA, in a speech last week at the University of Maryland. The venue was chosen in a nod to the young, climate-concerned voters Joe Biden hopes to court in next year\u2019s presidential election, and who have been dismayed by Biden\u2019s acquiescence to large-scale oil and gas drilling.\n\n\u201cFolks, this is our future we are talking about, and we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity for real climate action,\u201d Regan added. \u201cFailure is not an option, indifference is not an option, inaction is not an option.\u201d\n\nThe various climate rules have involved grueling preparation from an agency still considered understaffed from the Trump years and now face a gamut of challenges. The right-leaning US supreme court limited the EPA\u2019s options for cutting power plant emissions in a ruling last year and further legal challenges from Republican-led states are inevitable.\n\n\u201cThis rule appears to utterly fly in the face of the rule of law,\u201d said Patrick Morrisey, the attorney general of West Virginia, which triumphed in last year\u2019s case. \u201cWe expect that we would once again prevail in court against this out-of-control agency.\u201d\n\nEven if the regulations survive the whim of the courts, they could still be overturned by a future president or reversed by Congress using a review mechanism that will only be negated if the rules are finalized and enacted by next summer, a tight timeline.\n\n\u201cThey do need to go further, faster, but I think the EPA recognizes the urgency on all fronts,\u201d said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen, an environmental campaign group. \u201cCarbon pollution in the power sector is currently unregulated which is a really big hole in tackling the climate crisis. It\u2019s good to see President Biden leaning in on this, even in the face of a Maga majority on the supreme court.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just climate the EPA has acted upon in recent months. There are new standards for chemical plants, such as those that blight the so-called \u201cCancer Alley\u201d of the US, from emitting cancer-causing toxins such as benzene, ethylene oxide and vinyl chloride. New rules curbing mercury, arsenic and lead from industrial facilities have been released, as have tighter limits on emissions of soot and the first ever regulations targeting the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (or PFAS) in drinking water.\n\n\u201cThis action all seems new, it seems different,\u201d said Burke. \u201cSome of the things have made me think, \u2018Wow, we were working on that 10 years ago. It\u2019s a shame we lost a decade on it.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor those inside the agency, the breakneck pace has been enervating. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a race against time,\u201d said one senior EPA official, who asked not to be named. \u201cThe clock is ticking. It is a sprint through a marathon and it is exhausting.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration will now have to walk the tightrope between opponents who claim the rules will cause the lights to blink off across America \u2013 Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat senator and coal baron, said he will block EPA nominees for following a \u201cradical climate agenda\u201d that risks prematurely shuttering coal plants \u2013 and ostensibly supportive environmental groups that have complained the power plant rule doesn\u2019t go far enough and has carve-outs for newer and intermittent polluting plants.\n\nA key point of contention is the rule\u2019s indirect embrace of carbon capture technology. In order to hew to the supreme court\u2019s verdict from last year, the EPA is requiring emissions cuts that can be reasonably made on-site by individual power plants, rather than to reshape the entire electricity grid towards solar and wind power.\n\nThese cuts could be made by scrubbing carbon from smokestacks, switching to cleaner fuels such as hydrogen or capturing the emissions and burying them underground, an expensive option that currently isn\u2019t being used by any coal or gas plant in the US.\n\nThe EPA has now essentially called the bluff of fossil fuel interests that have previously talked up the prospects of carbon capture, but both the industry and environmentalists have now expressed skepticism, with many coal plants expected to shut rather than spend millions of dollars on new equipment and pipelines to bury emissions.\n\nBiden also still has to grapple with accusations that his administration is fatally undermining its own progress by continuing to approve oil and gas drilling leases, at a rate faster than even under Trump, despite his promises to end drilling on public lands. The controversial decision in March to allow the vast Willow oil project in Alaska \u2013 a development that former vice-president Al Gore called \u201crecklessly irresponsible\u201d \u2013 will result in nearly half of the emissions the power plant rule will avoid over a 30-year period.\n\n\u201cWe know the work to confront the climate crisis doesn\u2019t stop at strong carbon pollution standards,\u201d said Ben Jealous, the executive director of the Sierra Club.\n\n\u201cThe continued use or expansion of fossil power plants is incompatible with a livable future. Simply put, we must not merely limit the use of fossil fuel electricity \u2013 we must end it entirely.\u201d", "reference_output": " The Biden administration is attempting to pass new regulations to reduce carbon emissions from power plants, but is facing opposition from both fossil fuel interests and environmental groups. The EPA is requiring emissions cuts that can be made on-site by individual power plants, and if successful, could put the US within reach of reducing emissions by half of 2005 levels. However, the Sierra Club emphasizes that the work to confront the climate crisis must go beyond strong carbon pollution standards and that the use or expansion of fossil power plants must be ended entirely in order to have a livable future."}, {"id": "086ead4b-245b-4df4-ae88-9b794dd3f907", "input": "Title: Tracking Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio - Q1 2023 Update (NYSE:BRK.A)\n\nPaul Morigi\n\nThis article is part of a series that provides an ongoing analysis of the changes made to Berkshire Hathaway's 13F stock portfolio on a quarterly basis. It is based on Warren Buffett's regulatory 13F Form filed on 5/15/2023. Please visit our Tracking 10 Years Of Berkshire Hathaway's Investment Portfolio article series for an idea on how his holdings have progressed over the years and our previous update for the moves in Q4 2022.\n\nDuring Q1 2023, Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) 13F stock portfolio value increased from ~$299B to ~$325B. The increase was primarily due to the addition of General RE's equity holdings to Berkshire's 13F report. They were reported separately before. The top five positions account for ~77% of the portfolio: Apple Inc., Bank of America, American Express, Coca Cola, and Chevron. There are 46 individual stock positions, many of which are minutely small compared to the overall size of the portfolio.\n\nWarren Buffett's writings (pdfs) are a treasure trove of information and are a very good source for anyone starting out on individual investing.\n\nNote 1: In Q1 2023, Berkshire Hathaway repurchased ~14.37M Class B Equivalent Shares for a total outlay of ~$4.44B. The average price paid was ~$309. Book Value as of Q1 2023 was ~$235 per share. So, the repurchase happened at ~131% of Book Value. In July 2018, Berkshire had announced a plan to make their re-purchase criteria to be more flexible - instead of the 120% of Book Value criteria, Buffett & Munger had to agree that Berkshire was trading below intrinsic value. The Class B shares currently trade at ~$324.\n\nNote 2: Berkshire Hathaway has a ~10% stake in BYD Company (OTCPK:BYDDY) at a cost-basis of ~8 HKD per share. It currently trades in Hong Kong at ~267 HKD. Berkshire's ownership is down from ~20% as of Q3 2022.\n\nNote 3: It was disclosed in August 2020 that Berkshire had built ~5% stakes in five Japanese trading businesses: ITOCHU, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo. The stakes were increased to ~7.4% each this quarter. The 2021 AR had the following regarding these positions - 5.6% ownership stake in ITOCHU Corporation (OTCPK:ITOCF) at a cost-basis of $23.52, 5.5% ownership stake in Mitsubishi Corporation (OTCPK:MSBHF) at a cost-basis of $25.72, and 5.7% ownership stake in Mitsui & Co. (OTCPK:MITSF) at a cost-basis of $17.29. ITOCF, MSBHF, and MITSF currently trade at $34.67, $39.92, and $31.55, respectively.\n\nNew Stakes:\n\nCapital One Financial (COF): The 0.29% of the portfolio stake in COF was purchased this quarter at prices between ~$90 and ~$122 and the stock currently trades just below that range at ~$89.\n\nDiageo plc (DEO) and Vitesse Energy (VTS): The very small DEO stake was part of General RE's equity holdings, which is now consolidated in Berkshire's 13F report. Vitesse Energy is a spin-off from Jefferies that started trading in January.\n\nStake Disposals:\n\nBank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK): BK was a 0.38% of the 13F portfolio stake. The bulk of the original position was purchased in Q2 2012 at prices between $19.50 and $25. Recent activity follows: 2017 saw a ~180% increase at prices between $43.50 and $55 while 2018 saw another one-third increase at prices between $44.50 and $58.50. Q3 2022 saw a ~14% selling at prices between ~$39 and ~$45. That was followed with a ~60% reduction last quarter at prices between ~$37 and ~$46. The disposal this quarter was at prices between ~$43 and ~$52. The stock currently trades at $40.70. Berkshire's cost-basis on BK was ~$46 per share.\n\nRH (RH): The 0.21% of the portfolio RH position was established in Q3 2019 at prices between $119 and $174 and increased by ~40% next quarter at prices between $165 and $242. Q1 2022 saw another ~20% stake increase at prices between ~$321 and ~$538. The position was sold this quarter at prices between ~$238 and ~$347. The stock currently trades at ~$265.\n\nTaiwan Semi (TSM): TSM is a now a small 0.21% of the portfolio stake. A fairly large stake was purchased last quarter at prices between ~$69 and ~$92. Last quarter saw the position sold down by ~85% at prices between ~$60 and ~$83. The remainder stake was sold this quarter. The stock currently trades at $85.66.\n\nU.S. Bancorp (USB): The USB stake has been in the portfolio since 2006. The original position was tripled during the 2007-2009 timeframe. It was then kept relatively steady till Q2 2013 when ~17M shares were purchased at prices between $32 and $36. H1 2018 had seen a ~16% increase at prices between $49 and $58 and that was followed with a ~25% increase in Q3 2018 at prices between $50 and $55. Q3 2022 saw a ~35% reduction at prices between ~$40 and ~$49. The last quarter saw another ~90% selling at prices between ~$39 and ~$46. The stock is now at $29.65.

If a spectrum of possible chemical compounds serves as a map of what to look for, X marked the spot of water vapor on Comet Read \u2013 a long-sought clue in the larger mystery of how Earth\u2019s liquid water, and consequently life, first came to be. However, carbon dioxide was missing from the map, though it is present in all other comets. So in addition to continuing to pursue the history of ancient water in the solar system, scientists have an unexpected new quest on their hands, and will be hunting for answers in our cosmic backyard.\n\nNASA\u2019s Webb Finds Water, and a New Mystery, in Rare Main Belt Comet\n\nNASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope has enabled another long-sought scientific breakthrough, this time for solar system scientists studying the origins of Earth\u2019s abundant water. Using Webb\u2019s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instrument, astronomers have confirmed gas \u2013 specifically water vapor \u2013 around a comet in the main asteroid belt for the first time, indicating that water ice from the primordial solar system can be preserved in that region. However, the successful detection of water comes with a new puzzle: unlike other comets, Comet 238P/Read had no detectable carbon dioxide.\n\n\u201cOur water-soaked world, teeming with life and unique in the universe as far as we know, is something of a mystery \u2013 we\u2019re not sure how all this water got here,\u201d said Stefanie Milam, Webb deputy project scientist for planetary science and a co-author on the study reporting the finding. \u201cUnderstanding the history of water distribution in the solar system will help us to understand other planetary systems, and if they could be on their way to hosting an Earth-like planet,\u201d she added.\n\nComet Read is a main belt comet \u2013 an object that resides in the main asteroid belt but which periodically displays a halo, or coma, and tail like a comet. Main belt comets themselves are a fairly new classification, and Comet Read was one of the original three comets used to establish the category. Before that, comets were understood to reside in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud, beyond the orbit of Neptune, where their ices could be preserved farther from the Sun. Frozen material that vaporizes as they approach the Sun is what gives comets their distinctive coma and streaming tail, differentiating them from asteroids. Scientists have long speculated that water ice could be preserved in the warmer asteroid belt, inside the orbit of Jupiter, but definitive proof was elusive \u2013 until Webb.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve seen objects in the main belt with all the characteristics of comets, but only with this precise spectral data from Webb can we say yes, it\u2019s definitely water ice that is creating that effect,\u201d explained astronomer Michael Kelley of the University of Maryland, lead author of the study.\n\n\u201cWith Webb\u2019s observations of Comet Read, we can now demonstrate that water ice from the early solar system can be preserved in the asteroid belt,\u201d Kelley said.\n\nThe missing carbon dioxide was a bigger surprise. Typically, carbon dioxide makes up about 10 percent of the volatile material in a comet that can be easily vaporized by the Sun\u2019s heat. The science team presents two possible explanations for the lack of carbon dioxide. One possibility is that Comet Read had carbon dioxide when it formed but has lost that because of warm temperatures.\n\n\u201cBeing in the asteroid belt for a long time could do it \u2013 carbon dioxide vaporizes more easily than water ice, and could percolate out over billions of years,\u201d Kelley said. Alternatively, he said, Comet Read may have formed in a particularly warm pocket of the solar system, where no carbon dioxide was available.\n\nThe next step is taking the research beyond Comet Read to see how other main belt comets compare, says astronomer Heidi Hammel of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), lead for Webb\u2019s Guaranteed Time Observations for solar system objects and co-author of the study. \u201cThese objects in the asteroid belt are small and faint, and with Webb we can finally see what is going on with them and draw some conclusions. Do other main belt comets also lack carbon dioxide? Either way, it will be exciting to find out,\u201d Hammel said.\n\nCo-author Milam imagines the possibilities of bringing the research even closer to home. \u201cNow that Webb has confirmed there is water preserved as close as the asteroid belt, it would be fascinating to follow up on this discovery with a sample collection mission, and learn what else the main belt comets can tell us.\u201d\n\nThe study is published in the journal Nature.\n\nReference: \u201cSpectroscopic identification of water emission from a main-belt comet\u201d by Michael S.

But through the clouds comes a faint shard of light: scientists have discovered a second person who should have experienced symptoms of Alzheimer's in his early 40s, but didn't.\n\nThe case joins another who was identified several years ago with a genetic mutation thought to have played a role in delaying signs of her own underlying Alzheimer's pathology.\n\nInstead of receiving a life-altering diagnosis in his prime, the recently described Colombian man carried on working until he retired in his early 60s, and only then, years later at 67, did the first signs of cognitive decline materialize.\n\nBrain scans revealed his brain had atrophied and was laden with the classic, molecular hallmarks of the disease: high numbers of sticky protein clumps known as amyloid plaques, along with a few knotted tangles of another protein called tau. These kinds of aggregates are usually seen in people with severe dementia. Yet the man had somehow resisted Alzheimer's disease far longer than anyone expected.\n\nIt turns out, that in addition to the genetic variant that foretold his diagnosis, the man also carried a rare variant in another gene encoding a protein called reelin that seemingly protected him from developing Alzheimer's disease for more than two decades.\n\nIn one small, specific part of his brain where neurons are involved in memory and navigation, the man had very low levels of tangled tau. It was as if the genetic lottery had gifted him a protective protein that held Alzheimer's disease at bay in this one critical brain region that usually succumbs to the disease quite early.\n\nWhile little is currently known about reelin's role in Alzheimer's disease, animal experiments by a team of researchers headed up by Colombian neurologist Francisco Lopera showed that the mutated form of reelin also stopped tau proteins knotting together around neurons in the brains of mice. The team's findings are published Nature Medicine.\n\nNeuroscientist Catherine Kaczorowski, who was not involved in the research, told Nature that reading the paper \"made the hair on my arms stand up.\"\n\n\"It's just such an important new avenue to pursue new therapies for Alzheimer's disease,\" said Kaczorowski, a researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe hope is that by studying how reelin interacts with Alzheimer's proteins and protects neurons in their clutches, researchers could potentially find a way to boost resilience across all forms of Alzheimer's disease, and not just in those who inherit its protective variant.\n\nThough it is from families like the one Lopera has been following in Colombia for nearly 40 years that we are learning so much about Alzheimer's disease. In the man's extended family, which spans decades, generations, and some 6,000 people, many harbor a common mutation that causes Alzheimer's to strike early, in middle age.\n\nIt is typically referred to as the Paisa mutation after those in Colombia's Antioquia region, who have offered up their blood, bodies, and brains to aid research.\n\nAs journalist Jennie Erin Smith wrote for Undark in 2019, Alzheimer's research \"leans heavily on families with early-onset, genetic forms of the disease to understand its progress and test therapies that might interrupt it.\"\n\nIn the latest study, Lopera, at the University of Antioquia in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, and colleagues analyzed clinical and genetic data from about 1,200 individuals of that Colombian kindred. They identified the new and extremely rare variant in the man who remained cognitively intact, as well as his sister, who was less protected than her brother and died years earlier.\n\nIn 2019, Lopera and his colleagues reported another case of a woman carrying the Paisa mutation who showed no signs of cognitive decline until her 70s \u2013 some 30-odd years later than expected for carriers of the mutation. Studies showed she too had unusually low levels of tau throughout her brain, but her resilience to Alzheimer's was attributed to a different mutation in another gene: APOE.\n\nResearchers think there may be some overlap or interplay between the variant reelin and APOE proteins that could explain their protective effect, yet it's possible that other genetic variants contribute too. For now, Lopera and colleagues say their findings only help shape new hypotheses about Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn time, if treatments to tap into the reelin signaling pathway could be developed, they \"may have a profound therapeutic impact on the resistance to tau pathology and neurodegeneration, and resilience against cognitive decline and dementia in Alzheimer's disease,\" the researchers conclude.\n\nThe research has been published in Nature Medicine.", "reference_output": " Scientists have identified a second person with a rare genetic mutation that protects them from Alzheimer's disease.

Despite a troubled start to its life, Skylab pioneered long-duration spaceflight, and fifty years later lessons learned in this program are still contributing to the success of the International Space Station.\n\nWith Apollo 11\u2019s successful landing on the Moon in July 1969, NASA had met President Kennedy\u2019s challenge of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth by the end of the 1960s. While six more crewed lunar missions would follow over the next three and a half years, the objective had been achieved and funding was cut. With missions past Apollo 17 canceled, NASA\u2019s attention returned to low Earth orbit, and the development of a space station using Apollo hardware. This would allow the agency to continue scientific research and study the effects of spaceflight on crews over the course of long-duration missions.\n\nThe launch of Skylab came two years after the Soviet Union had deployed the world\u2019s first space station, Salyut 1. This station only hosted a single crew, which arrived aboard the ill-fated Soyuz 11 mission in June 1971, the earlier Soyuz 10 mission having failed to dock. After three weeks aboard Salyut 1 the Soyuz 11 crew returned to Earth, but were killed when their capsule depressurized during re-entry.\n\nAlthough the Soviet Union would launch three more space stations in 1972 and early 1973, the first of these failed to reach orbit and the next two malfunctioned shortly after deployment, with no Soyuz missions being launched to any of them. Skylab was, therefore, the second space station to be crewed in orbit, but as of 2023 it remains the only crewed station to have been operated exclusively by the United States.\n\nDesign and Launch\n\nWith a mass of 76,500 kilograms (168,800 lb) and a length of 25 meters (82 feet), Skylab was considerably larger than Salyut and still remains the largest monolithic space station (i.e. deployed as a single unit) ever launched and one of the largest spacecraft ever to operate in Earth orbit. Only modular space stations assembled in orbit (specifically Mir and the International Space Station), the Space Shuttle orbiters, and Buran have surpassed it in mass. The Soviet Polyus experimental military platform also had a greater mass than Skylab, however it failed to reach orbit.\n\nSkylab\u2019s large size was a result of its use of surplus hardware from the Apollo program. Its Orbital Workshop (OWS), the main section of Skylab, was converted from an S-IVB stage that had been intended for a Saturn IB rocket. A Saturn V rocket left over from the cancellation of the last three planned lunar Apollo missions would be used to place it into orbit.\n\nAlongside the lunar program, NASA had planned the Apollo Applications Programme (AAP) to take advantage of hardware and technologies developed during Apollo for a range of other missions. The Orbital Workshop had originated from this project, with two concepts being considered: the \u201cDry Workshop\u201d \u2013 which would see the stage converted before launch \u2013 and the \u201cWet Workshop\u201d which would convert a live S-IVB stage from a Saturn IB launch on-orbit.\n\nAs a dedicated station, the Dry Workshop \u2013 which would later evolve into Skylab \u2013 would provide more space for astronauts, be able to carry more equipment, and not require as much of their time to convert \u2013 allowing for more time on-orbit to conduct experiments. Since its main propulsion system and propellant tanks were removed, the station would not be able to contribute to its own ascent to orbit, so a modified Saturn V would be needed to deploy it.\n\nMcDonnell Douglas, the manufacturer of the S-IVB, would be responsible for converting the stage into Skylab\u2019s Orbital Workshop, under a contract signed in August 1969.\n\nAs well as the Orbital Workshop, Skylab incorporated a Multiple Docking Adapter (MDA) with two ports for Apollo spacecraft to dock, an airlock, and the Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) observatory which carried instruments to study the Sun. Although the station had two docking ports, the second was intended as a backup, rather than a means of having two spacecraft docked simultaneously \u2013 although this could have been supported if necessary. Power was to be generated by two main solar panels attached to the OWS, with four additional panels mounted at right angles on the ATM.\n\nSkylab\u2019s launch would mark the thirteenth and final flight of the legendary Saturn V rocket, which had powered previous Apollo missions on their journeys to the Moon. For the Skylab mission, the rocket flew in a two-stage configuration, with the Orbital Workshop taking the place of the S-IVB third stage. The rocket\u2019s instrument unit (IU) was incorporated at the forward end of the OWS, with a four-sector payload fairing encapsulating the airlock, MDA and ATM.\n\nFor launch, the ATM stowed forward of the main docking port. Once in orbit, it was relocated to its operational position perpendicular to the rest of the station. The Skylab launch was the only time a Saturn V would fly with a payload fairing. Like earlier Saturn V missions, the rocket was assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center, with build-up commencing on Aug. 2, 1972. The rocket was stacked atop Mobile Launcher 2, which was then moved to Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) by Crawler Transporter.\n\nSaturn V SA-513, the rocket tasked with deploying Skylab, would have an eventful climb toward orbit. Liftoff occurred at 1:30:00 p.m. EDT (17:30:00 UTC) on May 14, 1973, with the five F-1 engines of the S-IC first stage powering Saturn aloft. After clearing the tower the rocket began a pitch-and-roll maneuver to establish itself on its planned trajectory, building up speed as it climbed and reaching Mach 1, the speed of sound, just over a minute after liftoff.\n\nAbout 63 seconds into the flight, the Orbital Workshop\u2019s micrometeoroid shield \u2013 which was also designed to act as a critical part of the station\u2019s thermal control system \u2013 suffered a structural failure and detached. Debris from this damaged tie-down fittings holding the No.2 solar array in its launch position, jammed the No.1 solar array and also damaged the separation systems on the interstage between the first and second stages of the rocket. These events occurred about ten seconds before the rocket passed through Max-Q, or the area of maximum dynamic pressure.\n\nThe launch continued, with the S-IC burning all five engines until T+140 seconds, when its center F-1 was shut down as planned to reduce acceleration. The remaining engines shut down in pairs, about 18 seconds later, before the first and second stages separated. Retro-rockets pushed the S-IC away from the S-II second stage, whose five J-2 engines ignited to take over the job of boosting Skylab towards orbit.\n\nA little under 20 seconds after S-II ignition, the interstage should have been jettisoned from the aft end of the stage. This did not occur as scheduled, with a post-flight analysis determining that one of the shaped charges responsible for separating the interstage had most likely been damaged by debris from the micrometeoroid shield. Instead, the interstage remained attached all the way to orbit, with higher temperatures being recorded around the base of the stage as a result. The rocket had sufficient reserve propellant to make up for any underperformance as a result of its additional mass.\n\nFive minutes and 14 seconds into the flight, the S-II\u2019s center engine was commanded to shut down with the four outboard engines continuing to fire until the nine-minute, 48-second mark. About two seconds after shutdown, Skylab was released from the second stage, which then fired retro motors to maneuver itself away and reduce the risk of recontact between itself and the space station. The No.2 solar array, whose tie-downs had been severed by the initial debris incident earlier in the launch, was caught in the exhaust of the retro rockets and ripped away from the station.\n\nDespite this incident, Skylab\u2019s deployment sequence continued as scheduled, with the payload fairing separating at 15 minutes, 20 seconds mission elapsed time. The station then re-oriented itself to the planned sun-angle for solar array deployment, and shortly afterward began to deploy the ATM to its post-launch position.\n\nWith this in place, the ATM\u2019s solar panels were deployed successfully, however the one remaining solar panel on the OWS failed to open. This left the station with insufficient power to support long-duration missions beyond the lifespan of the fuel cells on visiting Apollo spacecraft, while the loss of thermal protection from the lost micrometeoroid shield meant that temperatures aboard the station were uninhabitable.\n\nThe launch of the first crew to Skylab was delayed while NASA evaluated data from the launch to devise a rescue plan. On May 16, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) launched a KH-8 Gambit spy satellite, OPS-2093, from Vandenberg Air Force Base, tasked with capturing images of the crippled Skylab to help assess the damage. One of the satellite\u2019s two film-return capsules was used to send these back to Earth on May 21, by which point plans for a repair mission were in an advanced stage of planning, with launch four days away.\n\nCrewed Missions\n\nThree long-duration crews, each consisting of three astronauts, visited Skylab aboard Apollo Command and Service Modules (CSMs). All three missions were launched in 1973, with each setting a new record for the longest-duration human spaceflight up to that time. The crewed missions launched atop Saturn IB rockets, flying from the modified Mobile Launcher 1 (later MLP-3) at LC-39B using a \u201cmilkstool\u201d adaptor which enabled the smaller Saturn IB to make use of the Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) that had been built for the Saturn V.\n\nSkylab\u2019s first crew was commanded by Gemini and Apollo 12 veteran Pete Conrad, who was joined by rookies Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz. Designated Skylab 2, their mission lifted off on May 25, 1973, having been delayed from May 15 due to the damage Skylab had sustained during launch. While the astronauts had trained for a mission of scientific research, they found themselves responsible first for putting NASA\u2019s rescue plan into effect to save the space station that was to become their home for the next few weeks.\n\nAfter rendezvous with Skylab, the crew performed a flyaround of the outpost to inspect the damage. After the CSM was maneuvered close to the stuck solar array, Weitz performed a stand-up spacewalk from the Command Module hatch in an attempt to free the panel using tools mounted on a three-meter (10-foot) long pole, but was unsuccessful as a strip of metal blocking its deployment was wrapped around a beam and could not be freed with the available tools.\n\nThe crew proceeded to dock with the station, however their spacecraft\u2019s docking system failed to engage. After some troubleshooting, including depressurizing the Command Module again and removing the back plate of the docking probe, a successful docking was achieved.\n\nWhen the crew boarded Skylab the following day, one of their first tasks was to deploy a replacement sun shield which had been rapidly improvised on the ground. This consisted of a \u201cparasol\u201d device in a canister which could be deployed from a small science airlock on the Orbital Workshop. Once this was completed, temperatures aboard the station began to stabilize and the crew were able to begin their planned science mission.\n\nOwing in part to concerns around the reliability of Skylab\u2019s batteries, which could have jeopardized future missions to the station, another attempt to free the jammed solar panel was made on June 7. Conrad and Kerwin performed a three-hour, 25-minute EVA to cut away the debris and attach a tether that was then used to pull the solar array free. With this accomplished successfully, concerns about Skylab\u2019s ability to generate electrical power became less acute.\n\nA further EVA was conducted on June 19 by Conrad and Weitz, the first of several to change out film cassettes in the Apollo Telescope Mount. The crew returned to Earth on June 22, completing their 28-day mission.\n\nThe second crewed mission \u2013 Skylab 3 \u2013 was commanded by another former member of the Apollo 12 crew in Alan Bean. Bean was joined by rookies Owen Garriott and Jack Lousma for the mission, which lifted off on July 28, 1973, and splashed down 59 and a half days later on Sept. 25. The final mission was launched on Nov. 16, with an all-rookie crew: Gerald P. Carr commanding with Edward G. Gibson and William R. Pogue.\n\nSkylab 4\u2019s stay aboard the station would be the longest, at over 83 days. The crew returned to Earth on Feb. 8, 1974, after which no more astronauts would set foot aboard the Skylab station.\n\nAlthough its three expeditions are short by modern standards \u2013 the astronauts of Dragon Freedom\u2018s Crew-4 mission last year spent roughly the same time aboard the International Space Station as Skylab was crewed across all three missions \u2013 these were the longest human spaceflights in history for their time. As such, medical research was a significant focus for studies to ensure crews could remain fit and healthy during extended stays in space.\n\nA bicycle ergometer was provided for crew exercise, with the metabolic responses of the astronauts being monitored to track their physiological condition. Other experiments included a rotating chair that was used to test the astronauts\u2019 sensitivity to motion sickness and pre-and-post-flight x-rays to look for mineral loss \u2013 combined with the examination of urine samples that showed the astronauts were excreting greater amounts of calcium and hydroxyproline than expected.\n\nThe only research that took up more time than life science research was solar physics. The Apollo Telescope Mount contained instruments to study the Sun in detail, with the crew able to fine-tune the observations. A key objective achieved by the Skylab 2 mission was to record a solar flare in progress. Paul Weitz accomplished this on June 15, 1973, tracking a flare for two minutes as it rose and fell.\n\nThroughout the lifetime of the station, crews made a number of spacewalks to collect film cassettes from the telescope mount and to install replacements. A total of 127,000 frames of film were captured by the Skylab\u2019s telescopes.\n\nOther research carried out aboard the station included Earth observation, using photography and multispectral imaging, and microwave measurement of soil moisture. During Skylab 4, the crew was tasked with observing designated areas and briefed on what to look for and photograph, in an attempt to assess the utility of using crew to target observations.\n\nCrew time was also given over to technology development research \u2013 including tests of an astronaut maneuvering device aboard the station \u2013 materials science and manufacturing, astrophysics, and student experiments.\n\nLegacy\n\nWhile crewed Skylab operations ended with the departure of the Skylab 4 crew, NASA had hoped to reactivate the station once the Space Shuttle became operational. Ultimately this was prevented by a combination of increased atmospheric drag causing Skylab to decay from orbit more quickly than expected, and delays to the Shuttle program.\n\nUnder early plans, the third Space Shuttle mission would have been flown by astronauts Jack Lousma and Fred Haise, who would have deployed a module called the Teleoperator Retrieval System (TRS). TRS would have then been docked with Skylab via remote control from the Shuttle. Once docked, its thrusters would have been used to raise the space station into a higher orbit \u2014 or to deorbit it to a controlled re-entry if deemed necessary. TRS was later moved to the second Shuttle mission as the program began to fall behind schedule, but would be abandoned when it became clear that Skylab was going to re-enter before the Shuttle would be ready to fly.\n\nSkylab re-entered the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean on July 11, 1979, with some debris reaching the coast of Australia.\n\nWhen the Space Shuttle finally flew in 1981, NASA gained a spacecraft capable of carrying out significant amounts of on-orbit research independently \u2013 particularly when equipped with a Spacelab or later Spacehab, module in its payload bay. As such, the agency pivoted away from space stations and instead focussed on the Shuttle. A new station called Freedom was proposed in the mid-1980s, using the Space Shuttle to assemble multiple modules in orbit. While this was never built as designed, its design would later form the basis for the International Space Station which began on-orbit construction in 1998.\n\nThe end of the Space Shuttle program has seen NASA\u2019s primary focus shift back towards missions of exploration, with the Artemis program aiming to return humans to the Moon, while crewed missions in low Earth orbit are being outsourced to commercial operators. The advent of commercial human spaceflight has seen a renewed interest in space station development, with several companies investigating the development of new orbital outposts. These include Orbital Reef \u2013 a partnership between Blue Origin and Sierra Space \u2013 and Starlab, which is being built by a consortium including Lockheed Martin, NanoRacks, and Voyager Space.\n\nAxiom Space has already flown one commercial mission to the International Space Station, with another planned for later this month. These serve as precursors to the company deploying its own space station modules \u2013 initially as an annex of the ISS, but these could lead to a free-flying station in the future.\n\nAnother startup, Vast, has announced plans in the last week to launch a small space station called Haven-1 in 2025 aboard SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket. This is planned to host a four-person crew for thirty days, launching aboard a Crew Dragon spacecraft.\n\nAnnouncing the Haven-1 and Vast-1 missions to low-Earth orbit. Launched by @SpaceX, Haven-1 is scheduled to be the world\u2019s first commercial space station and will be visited by a crew of four aboard a Dragon spacecraft during Vast-1 \u2192 https://t.co/ToxFSiyQJj pic.twitter.com/YSPrM9Krtr \u2014 V\u039bST (@vast) May 10, 2023\n\nThe impact of SpaceX\u2019s own Starship on the future of space stations is yet to be seen. With the ability to carry greater numbers of humans or larger amounts of cargo into orbit, it could vastly reduce the cost of transporting crew and equipment to outposts in low Earth orbit. Alternatively, it might be adapted as a research platform in its own right, much as the Shuttle was with the addition of research modules, taking the place of space stations.\n\nNo matter what the future holds, Skylab was one of the first steps on a journey towards understanding human reactions to long-duration spaceflight which has enabled space stations to flourish over the subsequent decades. Building on its legacy, and that of the Soviet Salyut and Mir stations, the ISS continues to deliver invaluable science. The experience with long-duration missions that has been honed aboard these outposts will also be key to future spaceflight beyond Earth\u2019s orbit.\n\n(Lead image: Skylab in orbit, seen from the departing Skylab 4 mission.

The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, which sits at 6.55% as of Friday, he says, could go back above 7% if a default looked likely.\n\nAnother big jump in mortgage rates would be a gut punch for many homebuyers and sellers, who were at the brunt of last year\u2019s mortgage rate shock. Already, national housing affordability (or better put the lack of affordability) has reached levels not seen since the housing bubble era. If mortgage rates were to spike again, housing affordability could deteriorate to a level that exceeds the bubble.\n\nIf mortgage rates were to go higher, Zandi says, it\u2019d accelerate the ongoing housing market correction\u2014which lost some momentum this spring.

Introducing default risk, or at least the risk of delayed coupon payments, would be like an earthquake rattling that bedrock assumption, sending ripples through the financial system and causing investors to question the safety not just of T-bills but other assets as well. Critically for the housing market, the interest rates on mortgages would almost certainly rise in concert,\" Tucker writes.\n\nIf the U.S. were to default, Zillow predicts the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate would spike to a peak of 8.4% by September, while home sales volumes would fall 23%. When it comes to home prices, Zillow thinks a default would see national home values go down another 1%.\n\n\"Any major disruption to the economy and debt markets will have major repercussions for the housing market, chilling sales and raising borrowing costs, just when the market was beginning to stabilize and recover from the major cooldown of late 2022,\" Tucker writes.\n\nWant to stay updated on the housing market?
