"Explain like I'm five years old: Since plastic doesn't biodegrade, why aren't more houses built with plastic instead of wood parts?",9,3,"Structural plastic is softer (weaker) and more expensive (or at least it was until the recent lumber shortage), and it's also susceptible to damage from UV rays in sunlight (plastic exposed to sunlight will become brittle and crack and break).

Explain like I'm five years old: How did the restaurant industry convince the American population to pay their employees for them? Where did we buy into the tip system?,121,2669,"Short answer: it's left over from the Great Depression. There's several good explanations already here.    To everyone saying ""I would rather pay more and have the restaurants pay their servers directly"", I've got bad news. Several restaurants have tried that, and a lot of them couldn't keep good servers. Turns out, lots of people in the service industry like the current tipping model, that's why they stay in the service industry. (Myself included. I make on average $25/hr bartending. I'm a disabled college dropout with no trained skills. I can't make that kind of money anywhere that's not tip-based.) They lost staff, spent more money on payroll, raised prices, and didn't see an increase in customers. It wasn't beneficial for anyone.  https://www.google.com/amp/www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-no-tipping-trend-now-at-more-restaurants-with-2016aug31-story,amp.html","A local brew pub recently switched to a ""no tip"" model here in the US and received  quite a bit of backlash about it. The owner wrote a pretty extensive blog post about why he did it and how he hopes to see it play out.   Some of his key reasons:    * There is enormous inequity in pay between the servers and the kitchen staff. * Tipping promotes discrimination and harassment. * Tipping has an ugly history rooted in classism and racism. * Tipping has very little if any influence on the quality of service * Earning tips is the source of motivation is only half the truth * A major cost for any restaurant is turnover * Working in hospitality is a respectable career that deserves a respectable pay  Edit: I know this doesn't directly explain the OP's question, but if you read the blog post it does a good job explaining some of the history and why America should change it's ways.",0,22.0578512397

Eli5 How exactly does Noise cancellation work? That too in such small airbuds,948,5,"You know how your headphones can reproduce any sound? Noise cancelling headphones have microphones to detect what outside sounds you're about to hear and then make the exact opposite sound at exactly the right time. Any sound (no matter how complex or loud) + its exact opposite = no sound at all, much like 5 + (-5) = 0.  I could get into superposition and all that, but that's probably beyond age 5.","The sound you hear is a wave that is a sum of all sounds around you. Waves have a few relevant properties: They travel at a known velocity, and they are additive.  To cancel such wave in your ear: we measure the wave just outside the ear and play its inverse with a small delay from the earphone. Notably, this only cancels the sound in a very small region around the inner side of the earphone. Everywhere else it adds its miniscule amount of more sound to the wave.  For best results: You need a good microphone in both earphones, and a good algorithm to slightly alter the wave, to mimic hiw it will be altered by the earlobe (as the in-ear earphone sound is not altered by the earlobe identically to the sound coming from the outside). Fortunately, we can tune this individually: place a second microphone inside each ear canal (near the very tip of the earphone), and measure which delay and which amplitude modifications reduce the sound the most.  A good analogue: Look at the waves in the see. Measure the height of the wave. If it is above the mean water level, push the water down with a paddle you have placed under the surface. If it is below, push the water up. If you move your paddle at just the right speed for a given measurement, you can destroy the wave around your paddle (whilst creating a new wave around your paddle, propagating outwards and adding a bit to the waves everywhere else in the sea).",1,189.6

Start up Minecraft and lay out 100 blocks. That's not so hard. It'll take you, I dunno, a minute or two? And while it's not *short*, 100 blocks isn't some ridiculous distance, either.  Now, lay a 100 x 100 square of blocks. That's a hassle and a half. It's a minute for each row, so 100 rows is 100 minutes is about an hour and a half.

"Explain like I'm five years old: Why do humans tend to increase the tempo when clapping, chanting, or keeping the beat?",68,28,"The human brain keeps many “tempos” in and throughout our body. This typically applies to things we do unconsciously, such as our heartbeat, or things that we do semi-consciously, like our walking pace.  You know how your heart beat gets faster when you get excited? Typically all of the internal tempos in our brain start moving faster or slower depending on emotional state.  Songs that usually provoke clapping and chanting cause us to be excited, which is an emotional state that increases heart rate and other internal tempos.  One of the most difficult things for musicians to learn isn’t a brand new song, but rather how to keep correct tempos among songs for just this reason. We use metronomes when learning music to attempt to override our internal tempos, because those internal tempos if untrained may increase or decrease depending on how comfortable they may be with different parts of songs.","Musicians learn to mentally subdivide a beat into smaller divisions, which makes it easier to keep a steady tempo. This is especially important with slower tempos. Instead of counting “1, 2, 3, 4,” we count “1  e & a, 2 e & a...” (or something similar). Always thinking of the subdivisions keeps you from compressing the beats and speeding up. I don’t think non-musicians necessarily do this, which may account for the speeding up with group clapping.",1,2.4285714286

eli5 : where do bees go in the winter time ? i was always told they died out but surely they can’t all die cause then how would there be more bees next time ? do they hibernate?,1784,10,"In the case of honey bees, they do not hibernate. The colony begins to kick out most of the male drones. They are not needed since the colony will not be producing queens in winter, and they eat too much to keep around. The workers do retain a few drones in the colony. They condense themselves into a tight cluster, and sort of shiver together to generate warmth for the cluster. They move through the frames of stored honey, and when temperatures permit they race outside to eliminate and to gather water. Nectar is gathered in the warmer months and the bees fan it to evaporate the water in it. This becomes honey, and is a carbohydrate source. Pollen is also gathered and mixed with nectar, and packed into cells. It forms a yeasty-smelling, sweet “paste” called bee bread. This is a protein source, predominately used for raising brood. Workers also produce another type of food, royal jelly, from a gland in their heads. It’s a substance fed to all larvae for the first 3 days of their lives, and to queen bees until their cell is capped.   The workers, mated queen, and a handful of drones winter together with very little brood-rearing going on until spring, when the brood rearing begins again and the colony grows. Beekeepers sometimes stimulate early brood by providing artificial or natural pollen and sugar mixed equal pets by weight with water. This can be risky, because a sudden cold snap can make it difficult for the bees to warm all the brood. When the colony becomes large enough, it will then split in a swarm. This is when the old queen leaves with about half of the workers, and a new queen takes over the colony. This can happen more than once in a season, and generally ensures the colony has a young queen as winter approaches.  In the case of other quasi-social insects like wasps, bumbles, mason bees, etc, they don’t winter over together as a colony like true social insects (bees and ants). Instead, in the fall the bumbles begin to raise many queens. Those queens become mated, and each seeks out a secluded, safe space to spend the winter alone. The colony of workers dies at the first heavy frost, but the queens are safely hibernating. In spring, a mated queen will emerge and begin to build a nest. She will lay as many eggs as she can manage while building the nest out further and further. As her brood hatches, they begin to take over tasks like foraging, brood care, and nest building, until eventually the queen becomes an egg-laying machine. The workers build, forage, raise brood, and the queen’s sole purpose for the rest of her life is to lay eggs.","Bees hibernate in their hives/colonies over the winter. The honey they make from flower nectar during the warmer seasons serves as stored food for the bees, along with some pollen that they collect and store.  When we eat honey, we're eating the bee's food reserves.",1,178.4
"Explain like I'm five years old: London's population in 1900 was around 6 million, where did they all live?! I've seen maps of London at around this time and it is tiny compared to what it is now.  Was the population density a lot higher?  Did there used to be taller buildings?  It seems strange to imagine so many people packed into such a small space.  Ty",146,714,"Not specific to London, but here in North America population densities were crazy high per square meter of city space vs what we have now.  Like a factor of 20x higher.    Throughout the 1920s several of the 'problematic' city ordinances that urbanists like to hate on came into effect.  They came into effect to effectively ban or break up many of the dwelling that were catering to the underclass.  As an example, there were rooming houses dotted all over where one could rent a mattress on the floor for as little time as a night for what amounted to a couple bucks in today's money.  These houses would be stuffed to full of migrant workers and other assorted poor people.  Basically they were dens of disease, crime and filth and poverty.  They also represent the market providing shelter for the bottom of the barrel and for those who may not have the right skin tone to stay in better accommodations.  So, in parallel with the introduction of the car, the city passed zoning laws that forbade these places.  Now there were max limits to how many people could stay in a dwelling.  This shut down the boarding houses because the landlord can't make a go of it without jacking rates.  (If you can't have 100 people paying a dollar per night, then you need to find one guy to pay 100 per night.)   There were zones that industrial activity could take place and they must be separated from where people lived forcing folks to travel longer distances from home to job.  People use to have 'servant' quarters in their back yard, but banned.    This is kind of a poor explanation, but hopefully it gives some kind of a sense of what happened.  At the end of the day, some of the changes were needed to combat rampant social disorder, but many of the changes were pushed to the extreme in order to try and entirely eliminate the 'undesirable' parts of the population.

Explain like I'm five years old: How do medical professionals seem to accurately predict when someone “is getting close “ to dying when the cause of death is vague such as old age or a long suffered disease?,828,144,"Nurse here.   When we say that someone is going to die soon, what we're really saying is that there is nothing left that we can do to save them. Particularly in cases of old age or a long illness, the person has been kept alive, at least in part, by medical intervention. Medications, surgeries, medical devices or therapies. When these interventions are removed, the body is unable to support itself, so the person dies. We can predict a timeframe from experience. For instance, we know that, if someone is dependant on dialysis, and we stop dialysis, they will die within a couple of days, because we've seen it happen a thousand times before. We, as a profession, know from experience what a body can survive and what it can't survive.   Regardless of cause of death, there are certain indicators that tell us that death is imminent. Someone who is actively dying will usually start refusing food and drink. They will be in and out of consciousness. Their breathing changes. Their vitals (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels) start to change. Their hands and feet start to feel cooler. They stop producing urine.   Despite this, we don't always get it right.","When you work with the dying, you start to notice similarities in colors of various body parts, smells coming off the client and you see a decided decrease in bodily functions as you see the shutting down mentioned in the other answers.

"Explain like I'm five years old: why fish can’t breathe in air despite air having plenty of oxygen If fish use their gills to filter oxygen from water, why can’t they do the same in air?",4,2,"ELY5: Fish have special lungs called gills, which are like a stack of delicate tissue paper, with many layers of thin tissue all sitting next to each other. The surface of each tissue paper needs to not touch its neighbours in order to absorb oxygen from the water. If you soak a stack of tissue paper in water, and then take it out; it will be impossible to peel the tissues apart. This is exactly what happens to fish gills once they leave their water home.","its because the very delicate gills collapse and dry out quickly in air when supported and hydrated by water, and thus the fish effectively suffocates. Its the other side of the coin where we can't breathe underwater because the structures in our lungs are not designed to be able to efficiently take oxygen out of the water that is now surrounding them.  However this depends on the fish in question though. some fish are more hardy and can withstand longer periods outside the water. and some fish have special features that let them partially breath air, such as modifying parts of their digestive tract to function as a lung, using their swim bladder as a modified lung, or developing an entirely separate lung-like organ for use.

Explain like I'm five years old: What exactly is phlegm and why/how does the human body produce so much of it?,5,2,"Mucous is mostly made up of water, and is given its properties by long, grippy protein strands. The protein acts like a mop, but much better. I can hold on to itself very well, along with water, and even more water between the strands. Your body has lots of water, and it takes a very small amount of protein to make mucus. So unless you're severely dehydrated, or on the verge of death by malnutrition, you have an endless supply of phlegm.","Phlegm aka mucus of the respiratory tract is a very useful substance.    First lungs need to be wet so that oxygen can go into the body and carbon dioxide can go out.  Mucus is good for this because it is thick like mayonnaise and won't immediately run down and pool in the bottom of your lungs.  But even a jar of mayonnaise that you have shaken will eventually run down to the bottom of the jar.   So secondly, to avoid this, our respiratory tract is lined with little hairs that can move and paddle the mucus upwards.  This is great because in addition to preventing the mucus from pooling at the bottom of your lungs, it actually paddles the mucus up from your lungs and into your throat where it goes into your stomach.  This leads to the third great thing about mucus because it helps to keep our lungs clean.  All that dust in the air will collect in your lungs much like it collects in your house.  That mucus traps the dust and it is pushed out of your lungs and into your stomach where you can eventually get rid of it by pooping.",1,2.5

"eli5: Why do most racing vehicles (F1, IMSA etc) lose control immediately the second they touch grass where a 'passenger' car would retain some control?",12,4,"Racing cars can handle grass.  Here's a F1 car passing another on grass.  https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nzNZZiM8pjY  It seems like racing cars spin so easily on grass because they're often already operating near the limits of the vehicle on the road where there's more grip.  If they're turning as fast as possible, then suddenly lose half the grip by hitting grass, they are now going too fast to turn.  Acceleration and braking are challenging in the grass, because the car ends up with most the force on one side, making it want to spin.  Also, the grass can be very bumpy compared to a road, which makes it harder for tires to maintain good contact.  Typically, when someone takes a road car onto the grass, it doesn't happen unplanned while going as fast as possible.  Or with three times the power and half the weight of a normal car.     Road cars can lose control quite easily in the grass when speeds are high and aggressive maneuvers are taken. https://youtu.be/pA7BASFqXIw Skip ahead to 2:15","Keep in mind race cars are going like 150+ mph.  The forces needed to turn the car at those speeds are immense, and the grass and soil will sheer off under load, which limits how much grip they can have. While some forces are imparted and the car will turn slightly, it won't be perceptible compared to the car going 150+ mph off line.  A race car driving at slower speeds will have plenty of grip, just like your car, and you will see cars rejoining the track through grass, like in NASCAR or F1.  If you want to see why race cars lose grip, drive your own car at 150 mph over grass and try to turn.",1,3.0

The good news is they're slowly phasing it out though, and finally getting more and more regulations in place.",1,12.3333333333
"Explain like I'm five years old:What is it about doing actual homework, studying, work etc, that makes us not want to do it? Why do I have no problem""reading"" stuff on reddit, but dread reading my homework which is arguably equally as interesting! I would imagine it has something to do with the psychology behind HAVING to do it, versus reading things on reddit is by my own choice....any insight?  Maybe the answer will help improve my productivity and help me with this problem of getting distracted",23,9,"For me it's about reward.  I have no problem at all working until super late to close a deal if necessary. Why? Because there is a real tangible reward coming soon.  With homework? The reward is nothing more than your grade fluctuating a few points. Even with all the homework, 16+ YEARS worth, your reward at the end of the day is what? A piece of paper that doesn't even remotely guarantee anything?  It's difficult to give incentives to homework. Even if you've never gotten below a 95% in your entire life and scored a 2400 on the SATs, big deal. You're still being passed over in favor of someone who knows someone, a minority, or someone whose parents also went to the school and they donated some money. Basically, somehow subconsciously, we don't see a point to it.  Speaking of point - most of the homework given in school, especially k-12, is busy work. We don't care about half the stuff we learned in school. It will not apply in the least to our actual life. In real life we have computers and calculators. In real life if you DON'T use them, you will get in trouble. If it's not documented with a source, it might as well not even exist. No one wants to hear ""oh, from I remember in school, I think this is done this way"". So really, why bother drilling it into our heads?   In school I always hated English classes. It was always the same thing. Read some stupid fiction book, write what the teacher wants to hear, move on to the next book. Guess what happened? I have not read a fiction book since my second year of college. I hate fiction books with a burning passion. I do love to read - I'm a bit over halfway through reading a 600something page technical text - again for fun. I dreaded doing it because I thought it was nothing more than busy work.","We are cognitively lazy. Reading reddit requires minimal effort for stimulation, while homework and such requires use of cognitive resources and effort.  The fix is willpower and training good work habits.",1,2.5555555556
