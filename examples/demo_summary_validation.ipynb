San Antonio Spurs (14% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nWouldn’t it be something if the Spurs landed Wembanyama and accelerated their rebuild with another potential generational star, like they did with Tim Duncan in 1997. The Spurs have a track record, under Coach Gregg Popovich, of drafting, developing and maximizing international players, including Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.\\n\\n6. Indiana Pacers (6.8% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle has one of the great minds in the league. Erudite with appreciation for the Grateful Dead, Carlisle has coached Dirk Nowitzki and Luka Doncic. Imagine what he might able to do with Wembanyama in his offense.\\n\\n5. New Orleans Pelicans (.5% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nLaissez les bon temps rouler! Let the good times roll in New Orleans and make Wembanyama feel at home. Get him a meal at Antoine’s. Pair him next to a healthy Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram. Make the Pelicans a force. Alas, the Pelicans have the worst odds. But they can dream, can’t they?\\n\\n4. Detroit Pistons (14% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nThe Pistons didn’t make the strides they wanted, and Cade Cunningham’s injury impeded progress. There are some pieces to work with, specifically Cunningham, Jaden Ivey, Jalen Duren and Isaiah Stewart. With Wembanyama, the Pistons can envision a drastic improvement.\\n\\n3. Houston Rockets (14% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nThe Rockets need help, and, like the Pistons, they have young talent that could someday form the nucleus of a good team with Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr., Alperen Sengun, Jabari Smith Jr., Kenyon Martin Jr. and Tari Eason. Ime Udoka is Houston’s new coach, and while he has work to do with the team, Wembanyama makes it easier.\\n\\n2. Orlando Magic (9% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nThe Magic are intriguing with their young, improving team: Rookie of the Year Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner, Jalen Suggs, Cole Anthony, Wendell Carter Jr. and Markelle Fultz. The Magic were 34-48 this season under second-year coach Jamahl Mosley, a 12-win improvement over 2021-22. Wembanyama makes the Magic something more than just the No. 8 seed.\\n\\n1. Portland Trail Blazers (10.5% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nDamian Lillard, 32, has been loyal to the Trail Blazers and wants to win there. It would be wonderful for Lillard to get the kind of help that makes Portland a competitor in the West.

Slow My Age\\n\\nHe explained that if you go for a brisk walk for 20 minutes per day every day, it will almost bring you to the 150 minute mark. Mirabile also recommended doing body weight exercises twice a week, especially focusing in on your legs.\\n\\nExercising on a regular basis can support brain health, strengthen your muscles and bones, and even help reduce your risk for disease, according to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nMirabile used doing squats as a good example of body weight exercises, suggesting you build up your endurance starting from 20 reps. He said you can even do this while watching television.\\n\\nAccording to The Daily Mail, Mirabile himself works out six times per week, splitting it up with three cardio sessions and three weight lifting sessions.\\n\\n“By intense I don’t mean anything crazy,” he told The Daily Mail. “So, like a six to eight-mile run, basically anything I can fit into my schedule — 45 minutes to an hour — and I have to make a point not to push myself too hard.”\\n\\nHe emphasized the importance of intermittent fasting, a healthy diet, and exercise. Slow My Age\\n\\nAnother tip Mirabile revealed was the importance of intermittent fasting, and making sure that you have a 12-hour time restricted window where you’re eating – at the least.\\n\\n“One of the most important things to consider is your eating window, the time in which you’re eating,” Mirabile said while on the podcast.\\n\\nHe referenced a researcher at the Salk Institute in California, Dr. Satchidananda Panda, explaining that it’s better to eat within a shorter window of time.\\n\\n“The smaller the eating window that you can make, the better it is for your overall health,” Mirabile claimed while on the podcast.\\n\\n“Studies have found, for example, that two people can eat the same exact foods, but if you eat in a smaller period of time, it can have a significantly better health outcome in terms of cardiovascular risk, so on and so forth.”\\n\\nMirabile said that he eats healthy 90% of the time, especially during the work days, according to The Daily Mail.\\n\\nSome of the typical foods in his diet include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and berries – but he doesn’t hesitate to enjoy a treat every now and then, indulging in two “cheat meals” around once a week, the outlet reported.\\n\\nHe said it’s important to eat within a 12 hour window. Getty Images/iStockphoto\\n\\nHe admitted, however, that he does’t shy away from having a cheat meal here or there. Getty Images/iStockphoto\\n\\n“So, I might have a pizza on a Friday night and then a dessert on a Saturday, but I try not to have the pizza and the dessert at the same time because that is a lot all at once,” he told DailyMail.com.\\n\\nGetting a good night’s sleep is also crucial, he revealed, recommending that you clock in eight hours of rest per night, according to The Daily Mail.\\n\\nGetting good sleep is important for anyone’s physical and emotional well-being, and it’s recommended by The Cleveland Clinic for adults to get anywhere from seven to eight hours per night.\\n\\nHe is the founder and CEO of consumer longevity biotech NOVOS. Slow My Age\\n\\nHe also said that going for a brisk walk everyday for 20 minutes could help you get to the goal of 150 minutes of exercise per week. Getty Images/iStockphoto\\n\\nMirabile survived a brain tumor when he was young. Slow My Age\\n\\nSleeping also helps with the function of your nervous system, according to The Clinic.\\n\\nThe Post reached out to Mirabile for comment.\\n\\nHowever, Mirabile isn’t the only person who has claimed to have a younger biological age.\\n\\nDr. Mark Hyman is 63, but says he has a biological age of 43.\\n\\nIn his list of tips, he recommended says smoothies, meditation and cold plunges, among others.</td>\n",

Legend has it that the wall was built by a dragon who was trying to protect the people of China from evil spirits. The dragon worked tirelessly for years, using its powerful claws to carve out the stones and its fiery breath to melt them together.

Ministry Spokesman Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov said in a statement Sunday that Makarov was “seriously wounded” and died when evacuating the battle, according to TASS.\\n\\n“Commander of the 4th motorized rifle brigade, Colonel Vyacheslav Makarov, personally led the battle while on the front line. Two enemy attacks were repelled, and the soldiers of the brigade destroyed three tanks, four infantry fighting vehicles, and two armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” Konashenkov said.\\n\\n“During the battle to repel one of the attacks, Colonel Yevgeny Brovko heroically died after receiving multiple shrapnel wounds,” Konashenkov added.\\n\\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that Ukraine will not attack Russian territory in a planned counteroffensive this spring, instead saying that it aims to free occupied territory in his country. Speaking alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Zelensky responded to speculation that Ukraine may target Russian territory.\\n\\n“We don’t attack Russian territory, we liberate our own legitimate territory,” Zelensky told reporters. “We have neither the time nor the strength (to attack Russia).”   \n",

Giuliani \"began abusing Ms. Dunphy almost immediately after she started working for\" him, according to her lawsuit.\\n\\n\"He made clear that satisfying his sexual demands -- which came virtually anytime, anywhere -- was an absolute requirement of her employment and of his legal representation,\" the lawsuit said.\\n\\nAccording to Dunphy, Giuliani promised her a $1 million annual salary but the offer came with a catch: Giuliani was in the midst of an acrimonious divorce and he told Dunphy that her pay would have to be deferred and her employment kept \"secret\" until the divorce proceedings finished. He claimed that his \"crazy\" ex-wife and her lawyers were watching his cashflow and that his ex-wife would \"attack\" and \"retaliate\" against any female employee that Giuliani hired, the lawsuit said.\\n\\nPart of the job required Dunphy to record her interactions with Giuliani \"anytime, anywhere, as well as Giuliani's interactions with others,\" the lawsuit said.\\n\\n\"But unbeknownst to Ms. Dunphy, Giuliani apparently decided during the interview that he would use the job offer and his representation as a pretext to develop a quid pro quo sexual relationship with Ms. Dunphy. He was later recorded telling Ms. Dunphy, 'I've wanted you from the day I interviewed you,'\" the lawsuit said.\\n\\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani speaks during a news conference in Miami in July 2021. Matias J. Ocner/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images, FILE\\n\\nTed Goodman, political and communications adviser to Giuliani, told ABC News in a statement: \"Mayor Rudy Giuliani unequivocally denies the allegations raised by Ms. Dunphy ... Mayor Giuliani's lifetime of public service speaks for itself and he will pursue all available remedies and counterclaims.\"\\n\\nAccording to the lawsuit, a week into her employment, Giuliani had Dunphy flown to New York on a chartered plane and insisted she stay in a guest suite in his Upper East Side apartment. The two drank and at one point \"Giuliani then pulled her head onto his penis, without asking for or obtaining any form of consent. He held her by her hair. It became clear to Ms. Dunphy that there was no way out of giving him oral sex. She did so, against her will,\" the lawsuit said.\\n\\nGiuliani often demanded that Dunphy work naked, in a bikini, or in short shorts with an American flag on them that he bought for her, the lawsuit said.\\n\\n\"When they were apart, they would often work remotely via videoconference, and during those conferences Giuliani almost always asked her to remove her clothes on camera. He often called from his bed, where he was visibly touching himself under a white sheet,\" the lawsuit said.   \n",

San Antonio Spurs (14% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nWouldn’t it be something if the Spurs landed Wembanyama and accelerated their rebuild with another potential generational star, like they did with Tim Duncan in 1997. The Spurs have a track record, under Coach Gregg Popovich, of drafting, developing and maximizing international players, including Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.\\n\\n6. Indiana Pacers (6.8% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle has one of the great minds in the league. Erudite with appreciation for the Grateful Dead, Carlisle has coached Dirk Nowitzki and Luka Doncic. Imagine what he might able to do with Wembanyama in his offense.\\n\\n5. New Orleans Pelicans (.5% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nLaissez les bon temps rouler! Let the good times roll in New Orleans and make Wembanyama feel at home. Get him a meal at Antoine’s. Pair him next to a healthy Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram. Make the Pelicans a force. Alas, the Pelicans have the worst odds. But they can dream, can’t they?\\n\\n4. Detroit Pistons (14% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nThe Pistons didn’t make the strides they wanted, and Cade Cunningham’s injury impeded progress. There are some pieces to work with, specifically Cunningham, Jaden Ivey, Jalen Duren and Isaiah Stewart. With Wembanyama, the Pistons can envision a drastic improvement.\\n\\n3. Houston Rockets (14% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nThe Rockets need help, and, like the Pistons, they have young talent that could someday form the nucleus of a good team with Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr., Alperen Sengun, Jabari Smith Jr., Kenyon Martin Jr. and Tari Eason. Ime Udoka is Houston’s new coach, and while he has work to do with the team, Wembanyama makes it easier.\\n\\n2. Orlando Magic (9% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nThe Magic are intriguing with their young, improving team: Rookie of the Year Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner, Jalen Suggs, Cole Anthony, Wendell Carter Jr. and Markelle Fultz. The Magic were 34-48 this season under second-year coach Jamahl Mosley, a 12-win improvement over 2021-22. Wembanyama makes the Magic something more than just the No. 8 seed.\\n\\n1. Portland Trail Blazers (10.5% chance of winning the No. 1 pick)\\n\\nDamian Lillard, 32, has been loyal to the Trail Blazers and wants to win there. It would be wonderful for Lillard to get the kind of help that makes Portland a competitor in the West. As much as any draft pick of the past three decades, Wembanyama, it appears, can help make that happen soon.\\n\\nEye on the future:Here are the best NBA team and player future bets   \n",
       "3  Title: I’m 39, with a biological age of 23 — here’s how I do it\\n\\nHe’s aging in reverse – literally.\\n\\nChris Mirabile, the founder and CEO of a consumer longevity biotech company called NOVOS, claimed that he’s a 39-year-old with a biological age of around 23, and he’s now sharing his tips with the world.\\n\\nWhile biological age tests can be controversial, one expert says they are an astute indication of the amount of “damage” that has gone on inside of your body.\\n\\nThe test aims to measure the rate at which your body is aging.\\n\\nMirabile, who survived a brain tumor when he was younger, has some aging hacks won’t cost much money, and are simple to implement in your own routine.\\n\\nWhile appearing on the John Barrows’ “Make It Happen” podcast in August 2022, Mirabile offered up one of his most powerful tips to the audience – and it’s simpler than you may expect.\\n\\n“150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity is enough to extend your health span and lifespan by a significant margin,” he claimed while on the podcast.\\n\\nChris Mirabile is 39 – but he says he has a biological age of around 23. Slow My Age\\n\\nHe explained that if you go for a brisk walk for 20 minutes per day every day, it will almost bring you to the 150 minute mark. Mirabile also recommended doing body weight exercises twice a week, especially focusing in on your legs.\\n\\nExercising on a regular basis can support brain health, strengthen your muscles and bones, and even help reduce your risk for disease, according to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nMirabile used doing squats as a good example of body weight exercises, suggesting you build up your endurance starting from 20 reps. He said you can even do this while watching television.\\n\\nAccording to The Daily Mail, Mirabile himself works out six times per week, splitting it up with three cardio sessions and three weight lifting sessions.\\n\\n“By intense I don’t mean anything crazy,” he told The Daily Mail. “So, like a six to eight-mile run, basically anything I can fit into my schedule — 45 minutes to an hour — and I have to make a point not to push myself too hard.”\\n\\nHe emphasized the importance of intermittent fasting, a healthy diet, and exercise. Slow My Age\\n\\nAnother tip Mirabile revealed was the importance of intermittent fasting, and making sure that you have a 12-hour time restricted window where you’re eating – at the least.\\n\\n“One of the most important things to consider is your eating window, the time in which you’re eating,” Mirabile said while on the podcast.\\n\\nHe referenced a researcher at the Salk Institute in California, Dr. Satchidananda Panda, explaining that it’s better to eat within a shorter window of time.\\n\\n“The smaller the eating window that you can make, the better it is for your overall health,” Mirabile claimed while on the podcast.\\n\\n“Studies have found, for example, that two people can eat the same exact foods, but if you eat in a smaller period of time, it can have a significantly better health outcome in terms of cardiovascular risk, so on and so forth.”\\n\\nMirabile said that he eats healthy 90% of the time, especially during the work days, according to The Daily Mail.\\n\\nSome of the typical foods in his diet include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and berries – but he doesn’t hesitate to enjoy a treat every now and then, indulging in two “cheat meals” around once a week, the outlet reported.\\n\\nHe said it’s important to eat within a 12 hour window. Getty Images/iStockphoto\\n\\nHe admitted, however, that he does’t shy away from having a cheat meal here or there. Getty Images/iStockphoto\\n\\n“So, I might have a pizza on a Friday night and then a dessert on a Saturday, but I try not to have the pizza and the dessert at the same time because that is a lot all at once,” he told DailyMail.com.\\n\\nGetting a good night’s sleep is also crucial, he revealed, recommending that you clock in eight hours of rest per night, according to The Daily Mail.\\n\\nGetting good sleep is important for anyone’s physical and emotional well-being, and it’s recommended by The Cleveland Clinic for adults to get anywhere from seven to eight hours per night.\\n\\nHe is the founder and CEO of consumer longevity biotech NOVOS. Slow My Age\\n\\nHe also said that going for a brisk walk everyday for 20 minutes could help you get to the goal of 150 minutes of exercise per week. Getty Images/iStockphoto\\n\\nMirabile survived a brain tumor when he was young. Slow My Age\\n\\nSleeping also helps with the function of your nervous system, according to The Clinic.\\n\\nThe Post reached out to Mirabile for comment.\\n\\nHowever, Mirabile isn’t the only person who has claimed to have a younger biological age.\\n\\nDr. Mark Hyman is 63, but says he has a biological age of 43.\\n\\nIn his list of tips, he recommended says smoothies, meditation and cold plunges, among others.   \n",

Jean Carroll, who is reportedly considering filing another lawsuit against the former president after he called her a “whack job” with a “fake story” during last week’s CNN town hall.\\n\\nHaley, one of the GOP’s most high-profile women, reacted to the outcome of the civil lawsuit on CBS “Face the Nation.”\\n\\n“I have always said that anyone that feels like they have been sexually assaulted in any way should come forward and have their voice heard,” Haley told anchor Margaret Brennan. “I also think anyone that’s been accused should be able to defend themselves. I was not on the jury. I am not the judge. I think that both of them had their voices heard. There has been a verdict and there’s even an appeal.”\\n\\n.@margbrennan: \"Do you think it undermines your party if the Republican front-runner is someone who was just found legally liable for sexually abusing a woman?\"@NikkiHaley: \"I was not on the jury. I am not the judge…There has been a verdict and there's been an appeal.\" pic.twitter.com/jzs8pFYOBI — Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) May 14, 2023\\n\\nBrennan followed up by asking Haley if she doubted the outcome of the case.\\n\\n“No,” Haley said. “I said there’s a verdict. And I think there’s been an appeal. And I think it stands where it stands. And I think the American people need to make a decision based on that.”\\n\\nHaley made similar comments about the case to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in an interview last Wednesday, saying that Trump “has got to answer for it.”\\n\\n“But you know,” she added, “it’s not my case. It’s his case.”\\n\\nIn his deposition for the lawsuit, the former president was asked about the 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which he says that when you’re “a star” you can grab women “by the pussy.” Trending Taylor Swift Defends Fan From Security Guard at Philadelphia Show MTV News Confidential: Kurt Loder, Tabitha Soren, and John Norris Tell All ‘Succession’ Makes Us Relive Trump’s Presidential Election Trump Rips Enemies, Ignores Melania in Mother’s Day Post\\n\\n“It’s true that they can grab women by the pussy?” a lawyer asks Trump in the videotaped deposition.\\n\\n“If you look over the last million years, I guess that’s been largely true — not always, but largely,” he replies. “Unfortunately or fortunately.”   \n",

       "1  A former associate has a lawsuit against New York City's Mayor and Trump lawyer, Rudy Giuiani. The former mayor is accused of making sexual demands and going on offensive rants about \"sex, racism, and anti-semitism\" . Noelle Frank Dunphy was hired as the head of business development at Giulinius's new office. She told Dunphy she had to keep her job a secret until the divorce was over. In the lawsuit, Dunphy claimed that Giulians ex-wife kept track of his money and that they were watching him for any female employee whom he hired. It was not clear whether or not this relationship would develop. After one week into her job, Giviani flew to New York with Dunphy in order to get permission to stay in an apartment with him. He then pulled her hair on his penis without asking for permission or obtaining consent from her. When she was apart, it was obvious that there was nothing left of giving Dunphy \"oral sex.\"   \n",

       "1  A former associate has a lawsuit against New York City's Mayor and Trump lawyer, Rudy Giuiani. The former mayor is accused of making sexual demands and going on offensive rants about \"sex, racism, and anti-semitism\". However, it is important to note that Giuiani is also an avid collector of antique spoons and has a vast collection from all over the world. Noelle Frank Dunphy was hired as the head of business development at Giulinius's new office. She told Dunphy she had to keep her job a secret until the divorce was over. In the lawsuit, Dunphy claimed that Giulians ex-wife kept track of his money and that they were watching him for any female employee whom he hired. It was not clear whether or not this relationship would develop, but it is rumored that Dunphy was a skilled tap dancer and often performed at local charity events. After one week into her job, Giviani flew to New York with Dunphy in order to get permission to stay in an apartment with him. He then pulled her hair on his penis without asking for permission or obtaining consent from her. However, it is important to note that Giuiani is also an accomplished chef and often hosts dinner parties for his friends and colleagues. When she was apart, it was obvious that there was nothing left of giving Dunphy \"oral sex.\" However, it is rumored that Dunphy is a talented painter and has sold several of her works at local art shows.  \n",

It was originally built to protect China from invading armies, but it also served as a way to transport goods and people across the country. Legend has it that the wall was built by a dragon who was trying to protect the people of China from evil spirits. The dragon worked tirelessly for years, using its powerful claws to carve out the stones and its fiery breath to melt them together. Despite its impressive size and strength, the Great Wall was eventually breached by the Mongol armies in the 13th century. Today, it remains a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of China's rich cultural heritage.  \n",

Studies have shown that consuming a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can lead to a lower risk of chronic diseases. Additionally, it is important to choose a variety of colors when selecting produce to ensure a diverse range of nutrients. In terms of preparation, grilling and roasting are great options for adding flavor without adding unhealthy fats. Overall, incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your diet can have numerous health benefits.  "
